2021-09-25,"If Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona from 2008-2012 faced Hansi Flick’s Bayern Munich from 2019-2021, who would win? Would the Germans do another 8:2 or will the Spanish get the best of the Germans.

[View Poll]Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona VS Hansi Flick’s Bayern Munich? Who would win?",,1
2021-09-23,"Hi,

I'm aware that PSG and Bayern are *both* favorites to win the CL 2022, along with Man City. But I just have this feeling that PSG may or may not win it. They have Messi, Mbappe, and Ramos, to name a few...a formidable squad. Bayern, though, has Lewandowski Muller, and Kimmich, who are basically the top players in the world for their respective positions. Plus, come to look at Bundesliga matches, I'm seeing Bayern *thrash* opponents. PSG is faring very well, too, but something tells me that the final's gonna be Lewandowski v Messi, and the former will hold the trophy. I mean, I know barely any group stage matches have been played and it's not the best idea to draw conclusions so fast, but who knows?I feel like Bayern's gonna win",,1
2021-09-19,"Manchester United faced off against Young Boys in the first game of the champions league on Tuesday and were the first team to lose in the competition this season. A brutal loss in a game that they deserved to go home with atleast a point. However a costly error in the dying seconds of the game was all that those young boys needed to secure the first win of the competition.

Casting our minds back however they're are a surprising number of positives you can observe from the game if you are a Manchester United fan like me, but they're also some questions that still loom large over the squad as a hole. 

It's always good to start off with a positive and for me the main one was Paul Pogba, regardless if he didn't get an assist his work ethic in the second half was immeasurable. The way he was using his physicality to hold off the Young Boys was imperative in United holding off for as long as they did. I will never understand the hate he gotten from Tuesday because they're more than 1 way to effect a game and he done that in the middle of the park and for a man with 8 or 9 months on his deal he certainly put himself in harms way to try and get anything out of the match.

Another good point is that United with Van Der Beek in the middle just look more fluid. The range of passing from deep and letting bruno, pogba and sancho find more space further up the pitch. Sadly like every game he plays under ole it was over before it could start. Which leads onto sadly one of my gripes with the game and that's one's decision making. You could argue that ronaldo should of made the sacrifice and came of the pitch at half time instead of donny because then you would of had a runner on the pitch and not have to pull ronaldo off 20 mins later anyway for matic.

My second negative isn't really to do with the team and more the pitch. I cannot understand how its aloud to be used because strangely its a complete tactical advantage that Young Boys get playing on a pitch that others will barely do in they're professional career. I personally believe that if it was played on grass wan bissaka would not of made the challenge he did because the ball and himself would of been under much better control.

And my final point which is a positive again is that I think these young boys will struggle at old Trafford when it's their time to come over. The fans will have a grudge and hopefully the players will to. If Ole and Ronaldo have been free during lockdown I hope they watched the last dance and decided to take this personally because they need to operate with that mind set if they want to challenge for the title.

In my eyes this squads a cup team and have the individual moments of brilliance to win a competition like this, Which is good because that's the style that the manager plays.A reflection from a few days ago",,1

2021-09-15,"Can be surprised about the English clubs winning. There seem to be no limit to MC scoring. They conceded 3 though. Might be a problem against top sides.  

Liverpool got their win, but the two goals a cause for concern. Now it seems a success that they didn't lose to Chelsea early on. 

PSG, simply LOL. Don't have anything else to add. Disgrace and waste of money. Absolutely not a contenders for this year CL. 

Real won against the run of play. Really lucky there.

Ajax as usual. Attractive gameplay, too weak to advance. 

Everybody else was too boring to comment.

I think Malmö have great chance to take one or even 3 points tonight.
Malmö hasnt been best in Allsvenskan playing home draw 1-1 in their last game against Nörrköping. Game before that was a 2-1 away lose to Hammarby which is a pretty solid team. Malmö dominated that game with scoring places 22-9 to them. But Malmö was incredibly good and solid in UCL qualifying beating Ludogrets, Rangers, HJK and Riga. So i really think they can continue their great game at ucl stage.
And in other hand Juve has been straight garbage in Serie A and their most important piece in Ucl, CR7 left so i think they gone have tought time today in Sweden.
Let me know what u think of this game? Will Juve get their very needed win?Malmö - Juventus 1X",,1

2021-05-11,"So the top 4 automatically qualify for the CL in the Premier League.

With Chelsea and City in the CL final as well as in the top 4, their spot for winning it would be passed down to 5th place in the PL?

United could win the EL and gain an extra CL spot, but they’re in the top 4 as well. Will their CL spot go to 6th place if they win?

Chelsea play Leicester in the FA cup, which has a place in the EL. They’ll both be in the CL so that spot could then be passed down to 8th as 7th would already be an automatic spot?

The Conference League spot would then go to the team in 9th?

2021-05-05,"In the first leg the firsr half was really fun to watch, but after minute 55 or 60 it looked like both teams settled for a draw. I think 1-1 was apretty good result for Madrid, given than Chelsea played better than them, but I really don't understand why Chelsea wasn't more ambitius. There are several reasons why they should have gone for a win

-They were playing better
-They are in better physical shape than Madrid (whic is very important in the last 20-30 minutes of a game)
-They possibility of winning 1-2 meant that they pretty much were in the final, while the possibility of losing 2-1 only meant that they were compelled to score at Stamford Bridge.

After a very good game they settled for a 1-1, which only gives them the small advantage of making it to the final should tonight's game finish 0-0, which is unlikely. I think they were not very ambitious, definetely not a Champions League winner mindset. On the other hand, Real Madrid is not playing well, but when it comes to a winning mindset, no one is better than them. Let's see if Chelsea don't regret their decision today.Don't you think Chelsea wasted the second half of the first leg against Real Madrid?",,1

2021-04-29,"The 2019/20 Champions League season was full of twists and turns. First Ajax going out in the group stage, Atalanta's incredible comeback, and then COVID-19. But what if your club got another go at winning Ol' Big Ears? What if, you a PSG fan, felt you could've won the Champions League? This is Episode 1 of Classic Champions League, simulating a previous UCL campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

Group A and Group B saw the usual suspects go through. Surprisingly, Tottenham toppled Bayern Munich with an impressive 3-0 win in Munich seeing Gio Lo Celso, Hueng-Min Son and Harry Kane get on the scoresheet. Group C had the first real shock with Atalanta going out in the group stage, while Shakhtar Donetsk finished in second. Group D saw Juve and Atletico Madrid, Group E had holders Liverpool and surprisingly Salzburg going through, after a dismal performance from Napoli. Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund advanced from Group F, after Romelu Lukaku's 5 goals could only get Inter third place. Group G had Benfica written all over it. The Portuguese scored 24 goals and conceded only five, with Leipzig coming in second. Chelsea finished top of Group H while Ajax came in a close second.

For the Round of 16, I used the original formula (B2 faces G1 etc)

A late Jadon Sancho winner saw Borussia Dortmund beat PSG 1-0 but in Paris, Angel Di Maria scored an early opener while Neymar made it two to knock BVB out. Match two was Chelsea through and through. After a 5-1 win in Ukraine, Frank Lampard rested his main players for the second leg, which Donetsk won 2-1. Chelsea still advanced 6-3 on aggregate. After winning 4-0 at home, a younger Bayern side could still oversee a 3-1 win over Benfica in Lisbon, going through 7-1 on aggregate. After a 1-1 draw in Madrid, a late Fabinho winner from the spot saw Liverpool advance at Anfield, sending Atletico home. After a 2-1 win in Amsterdam, Jose Mourinho saw Tottenham through with a 4-1 win at home, sending Ajax out. After a Messi masterclass which saw Barcelona beat Salzburg 3-0 in Austria, the apocalypse took place in Barcelona as the Culers stuck nine past a hapless Salzburg, to win 12-0 on aggregate. After a 2-1 win in Leipzig, a CR7 hat-trick saw Juventus sail past Leipzig. Manchester City, meanwhile, won 1-0 twice against Real Madrid to ensure that there would be four English teams in the last eight.

&amp;#x200B;

After a 3-1 win in Paris, a surprisingly clinical Chelsea beat PSG 2-1 at Stamford Bridge to make the semis. After a 2-1 defeat in Munich, Bayern bounced back, winning 2-0 at Anfield to set up a semifinal meeting with Chelsea. For Spurs, it was heartbreak. Despite a 2-1 win at the Nou Camp, Barca won 2-1 in London before a penalty shootout where Messi sank Tottenham. Man City made an incredible comeback. After losing the first leg 2-0 away, a Sergio Aguero hat-trick sealed a 3-0 win and a route to the semi-finals.

&amp;#x200B;

Bayern beat Chelsea 4-2 in London and 2-0 in Munich to get a passage to the final. After a KDB brace secured a 2-1 win away, City shared honors even at home to reach the UCL final for the first time ever.

&amp;#x200B;

The final was scrappy, ill-tempered and honestly not memorable. An Ivan Perisic opener was followed by no action whatsoever, giving Bayern a 1-0 win.Classic Champions League - 2019/20",,1
2021-04-29,"For a fact,I know that a continental treble consists of the league title, domestic title and the champions league. My question is that, if City wins the premier league as well as the ucl and taking into account that they won the league Cup(carabo chin), will that be considered as treble?... I'm clueless, can you ask clarify?What counts as treble?",,1
2021-04-28,"In other words, which scenario is more beneficial for the second leg? I think it is preferable to close as a visitor, because in advance you know the type of game you should do, and if it goes minimally well, the profit is doubled by the double value of the goals. I ask because I have not found statistical referencesIs it more favorable for the return matches to be home or away?",,1

2021-04-20,"With the Super League dissolving before our eyes (Massive W for that btw), I have thought of a few ways that the Super League could have actually created more of a profit without losing the competitive nature of the game. That being said, this is a rough idea and I'm open to criticism, but I am certain that my idea for the Super League is 1000% better than whatever those frauds in suits came up with.

So first, let's talk about the issues the Super League is claiming to fix: attention. More specifically, attention from the Youth. The idea of the original Super League was to create exciting matchups and have them happen more often to gain attention from the Youth. It's idiotic, I know, but let's go with that. The Super League had decided that the solution to try and gain more attention from the Youth is to get rid of ALL other games against smaller clubs and just have the biggest and the best clubs face against each other for big prizes. How they funded this is through the betting culture that happens with crazy rich people, where bigger named teams receive bigger bets. If you're talking from a purely financial standpoint, it makes sense, why wouldn't the teams accept a $400 Million prize over a $150 Million? What I find most idiotic is that there was a perfectly good opportunity to take advantage of those added finances, during a time where it wouldn't collide with the regular domestic and international league schedule, and will keep the fairness as it should. And that leads me to my idea.

So, firstly, when do people watch the beautiful game the least? Is it in the beginning, middle or end of the season? It's a trick question, the answer is none of them. People don't watch when the season is over. Pre-season tours around the world exist, but no one is really tuning in to watch Arsenal play against a Chinese League team at 4 in the morning. So here, we have a perfectly good slot of time that can use some adjustment (given it isn't during a time where the World Cup is taking place). Great, now we've got that sorted. Now let's talk about the teams. Where are we going to find some high class teams to face against each other? Hm... How about the teams in the already existing teams in the European competitions? Europa and Champions leagues tend to have very good teams in the ends of their competition. Champions League finals are self explanatory, but the Europa League finals aren't half bad either. Inter v. Sevilla. Chelsea v. Arsenal. Atletico v. Marseille. Most of these teams had originally decided to go to the Super League anyway. So here's how I thought this can play out.

If we take the finalists of the Champions League and the finalists of the Europa League, we can put them in a group stage, where they would all play two games against each other for a total of 6 games per group stage. Once they are done, the top two face of in the final for the trophy and the bottom two face off for third place. This gives a total of 8 new games of high ranking teams facing against each other. I know, it's not gonna be nearly as profitable as the original 12 teams and their 22 matches together, but it is still an improvement. To be quite honest, this is really just an extension of the UEFA Super Cup. Instead of 1 game being played, it'd be 8. Giving those hungry bastards up at the top more money without ruining the game completely.

Now is this perfect? Of course not. It can use a lot of work. But the fact of the matter is that the ""solution"" those selfish pricks had originally created was by far one of the worst ways to handle this financial issue that they claim to have. It fixes the game to make the richer clubs richer with no opportunity for the smaller clubs to fight for their way into the competition. But my method offers a chance for smaller teams to fight for glory. Just look at some of the Europa League finals in the past. 2016-17: Man U v. Ajax. 2014-15: Sevilla v. Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. 2010-11: Porto v. Braga. They are all smaller teams compared to the ones that joined the Super League, and they now have a chance to fight against the other finalists of the two biggest European competitions. If this were the solution to the struggles of finances, then I would back it 100%. Then again, it's my own idea, so I'm biased, so please let me know how you guys feel about my Super League. I'm sure you'll think it's better, it's hard not to be, but is it practical and will it really work?

Tl;dr: The Super League could have been an extension of the UEFA Super Cup. All Finalists of the Champions League and Europa League are put into a group where they face each other a total of 6 times before the top two and the bottom two face each other. This gives a total of 8 new competitive games between some of Europe's biggest clubs while also keeping it fair for the smaller teams. This competition can be held in the pre-season time, similar to the already existing Super Cup, so it wouldn't collide with regular domestic and international schedules. This still allows the opportunity for big prizes, as most of what funded the Super League was going to be through the betting of big named matchups. It wouldn't be as profitable as the original Super League, but it also wouldn't lose the entire fanbase of the teams involved.How the Super League COULD Have Been",,1
2021-04-20,"Could this be start of the end of something that didn't actually started?

So the latest news and rumours, as I imagine most of you have heard:

\- Chelsea preparing to leave the league

\- Manchester City to follow the same path

\- Ed Wood to leave Manchester United by the end of 2021

\- Rumours that Andrea Agnelli (Juventus president) might be on the way out too

Hope to see more good news in the next hours.

I've already talked about it in different posts and like most of us, I'm against it. In light of these news I am still in favor of a good smack in the ass for the 12 clubs. I think all should take a little time off to think, like 1 year off European Competitions and the clubs that are still in them well.... get eliminated and maybe bring some of the teams that were eliminated in the past rounds?

I imagine that this would make a lot of you happy, mainly if you are fans of one of the 12 clubs and the supporters would suffer the most with it but... I'm sorry, after this I kinda want to see some good old revenge over them.European Super League 2021-2021",,1

2021-04-20,"If your are reading this, please accept my apologies for any incorrect english expression as i am not a native english speaking person, i will just try to speak my mind and toughs about the Super League problem and what UEFA needs to to do fix it.

First, lets talk about the problem, why the so called ""big"" clubs need this Super League, the economical mistakes that kinda forces them to try to get even more revenew out of the football industry.

Premier League top 6 clubs and Italian, Spanish top clubs are living above their sustainablity for years.

This is the main issue here, this clubs who call them selfs superior have during the past 20 expended millions and millions creating a monopoly above European football, for instance, teams that during the 70s, 80s and 90s became less relevant due their savage capitalist strategy.

Yesterday i saw an interview of Florentino Perez, chairman of Real Madrid, mastermind of the Super League, claiming we need super league to save footbal.

An absolute lie, the only reason why they need the Super League is because they cant no longer keep paying the huges expenses they created with their greed year after year, this clubs, had overpaid for players during so long, they created a standard, so the fee's and the contracts for the best players are so inflated today resulting in completely unsustainable economical model.

And in result of this this clubs are now facing huge losses during the current year, Yes Covid-19 is also helping, but not only that, because this clubs expend way above their weight.

Specially Top 6 EPL clubs, they have absolutely unrealistic budjets.

So strait forward, Super League is not intended to save anything else than their WRONG economical model.

  
And make no mistake as well, even if if the Super League goes further, this clubs will eventually have a total economical colapse, because they cannot keep paying what they pay to players.

Now lets adress the so called ""loss of interest"" Florentino Perez claimed yesterday about the group stages in Champions League.

He is perhaps right in the sense that games between a team witha 600/700 million euros budget vs a team with a 30/40 budget are not interesting...

But the main issue here, its not the team who plays with a realistic 30/40 million budget, the issue is the unrealistic and unhealthy 600/700 million year budget teams.  


People undersees it, but historical clubs like Ajax, Andelecht, Benfica, Porto, Sporting, Galatasaray, Fenerbach, besiktas, Standard Liege, Marseille, Celtic, Rangers or PSV, just to name a few. are not wrong, they are clubs who are owned by their associates by the most part the clubs generate income and live using that income, at same time doing what football clubs do, they generate players in their youth systems, they invest bringing players to Europe, they create stars...

  
In essense this clubs are the soul and the culture of European Football. yet, this clubs have been smashed disrespected and lost their competitiveness over the last 20 years because of the savage economical model a self proclaimed ""Elite"" of European football stablished.

Florentino Perez said Super League is an evolution to football, no its not...

I am going to argue why its not, i am not even Dutch, but i am lectured enough to know history of football and to love and respect the culture and legacy from the past.

Evolution in football is the game it self, its per example when Rinus Michells started his work in Ajax, in a team that was semi-professional, and he kinda developed a new model of play inspired by other managers in the past, and he developed a work that lasted a couple years, and ended up with Ajax winning 3 times the European Championship (later Champions League)

That would never be possibly currently, a manager currently would never be cappable of creating a style of play, neither a cultivate a group of players to teach them a specific game model, and develop those players to interprete such way of play in order to win.. why?

Because one season after a minimal sucess, immediately the rich elitist that expend more than they should, they offer absurds amounts of money to players agents, as well as players contracts and immediately seduce those players to leave the clubs...

Take notice from Ajax team 2019,  i am pretty sure that everyone who is reading this, still have pity that team completely ended after 1 year, because they failed the Champions League that yeat, but if they could play next year, perhaps they would win it, and this is the comparison with Rinus Michells era, because he took a couple years to develop the style, while you develop you do mistakes, they also lost a final hugely before winning, but in the end they suceded and football evolved throw it.

I think its time for the Federations of Portugal, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, Turkey, and any to work toghter to try to end up this savageness once for all.

The problem of football is not revenue, the game is healthy, the game provides huge interest, its not an interest problem, its really a wrong economical model system that some clubs are smashing the competitiveness for greed, they want to pay to win, literally and make money by winning.

This cannot continue, football is a game, its not a business, the industry should only be used to keep the game healthy, not to exploit the game and make the game lose interest, like they have been doing for 20 years.

This must STOP, i don't care what club you are if your reading this and your club is in the super League, your club will probably not even exist as you know it in the next 20 years, because the model they use, will colapse.

Take my worth for it, this bubble will not sustain it self, football needs to be self sustainable...

and  European football certainly would never work like NBA, this americanized ideas wont work in European football.

Football is cuture in Europe, it represents sociological ideals, they don't understand it, because this chairmans behind this clubs are foreign, some are just rich people, they don't understand the sociological purpose of football.

Why Celtic and Rangers are rivals, and why Benfica and Sporting hate each other, they don't understand it, they simply see this as an income purpose and UEFA must do something about it.

If UEFA intends to do something for the game, ITS NOW UEFA, the TIME IS NOW, this cannot continue.

2021-04-19,"Petition to STOP THE EUROPEAN SUPER LEAGUE :  


I’ve been a City fan all my life. 4000 miles and an ocean away they touches my heart. I put up a City flag. I wear the City kit. I painted the walls of my room blue, and similarly painted the walls of my heart blue.

Today my club as let me down. I am so disappointed in them. The agreement to the European Super League is ridiculous. As a Manchester City supporter, I thought we were better than this. I thought that at least it would be us who would be the good guys. I supported them through everything. I cheered with them, I cried with them. I defended my club from everyone who said that they were, “an oil club”, or “had no fans”. Today, even after years of support, and a year of not seeing my team play with fans, they turned their back on the fans. The same fans that they said, only a few short months ago, that football couldn’t survive without. Today my club let me down. They told me that I don’t matter. That the principals of soccer don’t matter. That the fairness and equality of football doesn’t matter. And that a story, that is similar to ours, of a club rising through the divisions to become amongst the best teams in the world doesn’t matter. 

 The European Super League is a disgrace to all of soccer, or football, all over the world. Teams with hundreds of years of history will all cease to exist. Thousands of jobs will be lost. Billions of hearts will be broken. 

Part of the beauty of being a soccer fan is knowing that anything is possible. If you support a small team, you could one day be the best. And if you’re a top team, you have to fight to retain your place. We watch and love football because of the competition of it. We understand that fairness is what drives the game forward and why we love it so much. A team like City, coming from a small team, fighting for a table with the big six, now arguably amongst the best in the world. Or Leicester overcoming the odds to win the league out of nowhere. These are the dreams and the ideas that drive us as a football supporter.  

The European Super League will take away this equality that we love. It will take away the competition that makes the game so special in our hearts. The teams that once dreamed of being world beaters would simply have their dreams cease to exist. 

They told us as fans that you don’t matter. They ruined my club. They  destroyed my sport. All for what. Money? They have all the money in the world. Fame? They have all the fame in the world? They had fans backing them through everything, and today those clubs turned their back on us.

I am not alone however. I am not the only fan that is sad today. I am not the only fan that knows what this means. I am not the only fan that has been disappointed by their club. I am not the only person that will be and has been affected by this. 

There are 11 other clubs that are part of this disgrace of a decision. They represent over a billion fans worldwide. And I know that they had their hearts ripped out too. But I know that if we all united. Instead of fighting each other, fighting for what’s right, this will not go forward. City fans, United fans, Liverpool Fans, Tottenham fans, Chelsea Fans, Arsenal fans. I know that we hate each other’s teams. But let’s unite together to take a stand. Real Madrid and Barça and Atlético, do the same. Juve, Inter, AC, you too. 

Its hard to come together with those that are your rivals, but as football and soccer fans we have to come together to fight for what is right. And we have to fight so that the rivalries that we have can stay alive.

No matter who you support, no matter if you call it football or soccer, we can stop this together. We can all unite and fight back against those who are ruing our clubs, our game, our passions. Let’s come together as a united front against this show of greed. Let’s together STOP THE EUROPEAN SUPER LEAGUE.STOP THE EUROPEAN SUPER LEAGUE",self,1

2021-04-06,"I'm not a dortmund fan - but watching the game is absolutely clear that uefa want city to win. Ridiculous refereeing. I really hope dortmund win now.
It took the ref 0.00001 second to disallow Bellinghams goal, which was never a foul, and yellow card for him (????), but so long to to take back the penalty for a ball to rodris face. And he didn't rescind the yellow for can.
I wonder how much this ref is being paid.Awful awful refereeing",,1

2021-03-15,"Hans-Dieter Flick’s Bayern VS Roberto Martínez’s Belgium National Football Team. Who would win? Who is stronger?

Under Martinez, Belgium are currently number one on the FIFA ranking. They came third in the recent World Cup. They haven’t lost a single game in 2019, &amp; only lost one game in 2020.

Under Flick, Bayern won Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, Supercup, Champions League, UEFA Supercup, &amp; also Fifa Club World Cup. They even beat Barcelona 8:2!

So who would win if these two sides ever met? Probably the best national team vs the probable best club today.

Anyone on Xbox looking to join a full-featured online FIFA career mode?

Hey guys, I'm currently a member of an online FIFA career mode -- NAFMO (North American FIFA Manager Online) with just over 34 other members currently through Xbox One, Discord, and Google Sheets. Given the structure that we've refined, it's a full-detailed career mode with transfers, youth academies, cup matches, pro/rel, scouting, and so on!  
We're currently heading into our final few weeks of the first season with the English Premier League and we're looking to fill out our EFL Championship so that we can have that up and running for next season.

Games are played through online friendlies using custom rosters, which reflect our rosters in the league. Each player will have two regular-season matchups per week in a two-game home-and-away series. There are also cup matches that occur periodically. There are custom league controls used to make the game a bit more realistic, and we try to tone down the skill moves to give it a more realistic feel and less of a Div 1 FUT feel. We welcome all skill levels!

If you're interested in joining the league, let me know and I'll send you the invite link in a private message.  


If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask! :)Looking for FIFA fans interested in joining an online FIFA 21 career mode/league.",,1
2021-03-13,"With Messi and Ronaldo out of the Champions League in the round of 16, for the first time since they were senior professionals, the QF will be played for the first time since 2005 with both players not involved - with Juventus losing to Porto and Barcelona failing to overcome a 4-1 first-leg deficit against Paris Saint-Germain. A young Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe or primed to battle for Football throne for the next decade.

I have decided to take step back and ask the question - which player out of Messi and Ronaldo is the greatest Champions league player of all time? With both men having owned this competition for over a decade. Winning 11 Ballon D’ORs and 9 Champions Leagues since 2006.

We’re not asking who’s is greatest overall footballer is, who’s better to watch, who’s the greatest la Liga player  or international player -  instead looking solely at the UEFA Champions League. Nothing less, nothing more. There will be no hot takes here. Some stats, some facts, some subjectivity...

2021-03-12,"Hello all! American here learning more about European football. I understand the breakdown of leagues and how a club qualifies for Champions League. That being said, it seems like the champions league is the ultimate achievement (like winning the super bowl or World Series in the US), right? As my access to European football and time/attention is limited, I’m trying to decide what I should be following to keep up with the sport and it seems like this is it.

2021-03-12,"I've been following Champions League for so many years and recently there's this thought in my head about away goals in extra time. I think it's a bit unfair since the away side has 30 more minutes in the opposition's turf, so don't you guys think that there has to be an alternative for this matter? I personally think that away goals in extra time from quarter finals and so on must not get counted as an advantage but for round of 16 still intact since the away side in return fixture is the one which finished first in group stage.Can we discuss away goals in extra time?",,1

2021-03-10,"1- Barça aren't the circus they were at the start of the season anymore, they kind of picked their shit together and played out a respectable 2nd leg vs PSG, and dominated imo


2-Messi is more of a big game player than CR7(at least atm), and all the ""Messi disappears in big games"" is just bullshit:Despite the pen miss, he still scored a worldie, and kept creating chance after chance for his teammates(too bad Dembele is just pure shite).All I'm saying is look at CR7's performance yesterday, it speaks for itself


3-Speaking of Dembele, Barca overpaid massively, his end product was shocking today, had he converted, Barca might have gone through who knows


4-Are we seeing an end of the Era of Juve, Barca, possibly Real, aka the 2010-2020 UCL era?Both GOATs have left the UCL in the RO16, while Mbappe and Haaland are through, will we ever see Messi or Ronaldo lift the UCL ever again?

5-Despite me praising Barca a bit today, they were really wasteful, they can only blame themselves, a pen converted by Messi, and Dembele scoring a few would've created another historic comeback, but not to be..What I personally learned from PSG vs Barca",,1

2021-03-10,"Thank God I chose to watch today's games(I also have a week long break from school so this made it even better🤩)

I watched both games simultaneously and holyy were they good!

First of all, Dortmund vs Sevilla, Haaland and En-Neysiri both shining, the Haaland goal disallowed then given as a pen, then missed, then retaken, and then scored. Also, those final minutes for Sevilla were just so good to watch, they were so close to equalising the game, tough luck to them for barely missing out.

Then, the big game, Juve vs Porto: this one should go down as one of the most exciting games in the UCL, a Porto pen made it so Juve needed 2, they brought one back, Taremi sent off, Juve got pumped up and got the 2nd, Chiesa was supposed to be the Hero, they kept taking shots, and narrowly missing.Extra-time awaited..

And oh boy was it an exciting one, again, both teams started attacking heavily, looking for a breakthrough, until, one far Free-kick from Sergio Oliveira somehow went past the wall, and slipped from Szcezny's hands into the net, Porto had gotten an away goal, Juve needed 2, it was all over..But they instantly replied with a goal, and were awfully close to scoring a 2nd, but ref blew Full-Time, and Porto had caused a huge upset, Juve knocked out from the RO16 for the 2nd straight season.

Those 2 games were the most exciting games in the Champions league this season, and the knockout have barely just started, I'm excited to see the rest of the games,another Remontada today maybe?Can we just talk about those matches?!",,1

2021-03-07," My husband loves football. Everywhere we go I try to buy a ticket for a match. At the end of 2019 I bought him the airplane ticket for Libertadores's final in Peru as a Christmas present and he was beyond himself. So I was thinking of scheduling a Champion's League final by surprise. As in, he would enter the airplane without knowing where we're going.

My question is: Is that even possible? I wouldn't even try for this year (Corona and all), but maybe for 2022/2023 (to save money).

How to buy tickets that are not hugely expensive? How soon should I book hotel and airplane tickets?

Thank you all in advanceTickets to the final - Impossible dream?",,1

2021-03-02,"Hello  fans!  I’m starting a football/soccer site called thefootyreport.com. It’s going to be a website dedicated to editorials and recaps on European ⚽️. We’re looking for writers who may enjoy writing just one article a week for us. I’ll be honest and say that since it’s just starting up there’s no way to make money however there’s a payment plan and the main priority is getting you paid. For now, it’s a for-fun thing for those who enjoy writing. 
I’ll attach the application link for those interested and if not, I just ask for you to up-vote this so more can see it. Feel free to message me if you have any questions.
Thank you!

2021-02-27,"I'm sorry but I'm sick of people talking about man City in the same breath as the great European clubs. They are a corrupt money domestic bully, nothing more. Like PSG but even less successful in Europe.

City have no European pedigree, never been to a final and seem to have a serious issue with 'bottling' European games.

People need to stop putting them in that category. Spurs have been to a final. Arsenal have. PSG have. Dortmund. I could go on. 

Until City actually live up to even a smidgen of the hype they get, I don't want to hear it anymore.

They won't win it this season. Mark my words.

They are a brand spanking new, small, corrupt, hypocritical, classless, plastic club who don't deserve to be lauded the way they are. They have done nothing of note in Europe.

Rant over.Why are people putting Man City in the conversation as Europe's best?",,1

2021-02-23,"Can't say I have ever seen Real Madrid as Underdog prior to the semis of a major tournament.  

Real Madrid is missing half of its team and if Benzema is out, they will get embarassed.  Atalanta plays like a pack of wolves.  They are out for blood and deadly on the counter.  

Its hard for me to place a bet against RM, but its not looking good for them.

Anyone on Xbox looking to join a full-featured online FIFA career mode?

Hey guys, I'm currently a member of an online FIFA career mode -- NAFMO (North American FIFA Manager Online) with just over 20 other members currently through Xbox One, Discord, and Google Sheets. Given the structure that we've refined, it's a full-detailed career mode with transfers, youth academies, cup matches, pro/rel, scouting, and so on!  
We're currently heading into our final few weeks of the first season with the English Premier League and we're looking to fill out our EFL Championship so that we can have that up and running for next season.

Games are played through online friendlies using custom rosters, which reflect our rosters in the league. Each player will have two regular-season matchups per week in a two-game home-and-away series. There are also cup matches that occur periodically. There are custom league controls used to make the game a bit more realistic, and we try to tone down the skill moves to give it a more realistic feel and less of a Div 1 FUT feel. We welcome all skill levels!

If you're interested in joining the league, let me know and I'll send you the invite link in a private message.  


If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask! :)",,1

2021-02-17,Hi guys. I would like to know your thoughts on future of Barca. What they have to change in order to return on the highest European and worldwide level. Right now it does not look good. They sell young talents such as Artur and take Pjanić instead. They still play Busquets in midfield as well.Future of Barcelona,,1
2021-02-16,"Well I guess knowing I dont remotely have to watch the 2nd leg of these 2 matches will open up a day for me to do something ""more meaningful"". I thought these were the 16 best teams in Europe. Barcelona looked like a group of 5th division players today. 

I hope the other games will actually be fun to watch.Today's games sucked.",,1

I’m looking for some ideas on how to do a fantasy/pool style betting on the champions league with my friends.

It is difficult since after each round the teams are randomized so it isn’t as easy as setting up a bracket pool and picking the winner.

Last year I did one where you choose the advancing team after each round has been decided.  Bonus points for picking the winner before the round of 16 began.

Anyone have any cool ideas that they do with friends for a group gambling pool?

2020-12-09,"Yesterday's match PSG vs. Basaksehir was a disgrace for the whole Anti-racism movement.

First of all the the indistinguishable Romanian word for black ""negru"" and the racist word ""Ne-gro"" have got potential for misunderstandings. 

But claiming the referees being racist is pure nonsense.
The player himself refers to himself /his ethnicity as black and he differentiates between black people and white people.
So why isn't the referee allowed to refer to a player with his his obvious distinguishable skin colour, but in contrast the player is. 

This diminishes the actual cases of racism, players being racially abused in Italy or Russia. 

From my perspective and the information that I got know this is disgraceful. It's getting into a state where it's like in the USA with the word rape. Because of the frequent wrong use of the word the actual cases don't get taken seriously enough.

Claiming that there are skin colour differences between people is NOT racist. And people are ignoring the actual racism.

In Africa in a room full of black people, you being the only white person and no one knowing your name... How would many if not all of the people refer to you...

Now, I’m sure a lot of you know how to change your flair at the click of a button – if so, great go ahead!  However, if you’re not too sure here’s an explanation:

**Old Reddit:**

On the right-hand side of your screen you should see “Select a team crest below!”, directly underneath this is a little box with “Select a team”.

Press this button and a small menu should pop up for you to select your chosen flair.

Once selected, simply press ""save"".

**New Reddit:**

On the right-hand side of your screen you should see “CREATE POST”, directly underneath this is “COMMUNITY OPTIONS”, press this to expand the widget.

You should now see “USER FLAIR PREVIEW” with a pencil icon to the right of it, press the icon and a menu should pop up for you to scroll through and save your chosen flair.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reddit Mobile App:** In the top right-hand corner of your screen you should see a symbol that has three vertical dots, press this - a menu should pop up. Press “Change user flair” and you shall be taken to a screen for you to scroll through and apply your chosen flair.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Mobile Apps:**

This shall vary from app to app, but take a look at the three previous guides for the other versions, it’ll most likely be similar. Look for something in the sidebar that references your “flair” or “edit” – any problems or questions, drop a comment below and I’ll do what I can to help.

I tried to put up a [**tactical analysis**] on how the two teams can line up before the match. 

# Bayern Munich

Bayern likes to dominate possession and try to control the proceedings in the middle of the park. Both of their fullbacks **Alphonso Davies** and Kimmich are good carriers of the ball and will try to use their speed in both attack and defense. **Thiago Alacantara** acts as the deep-lying playmaker who drops in front of the backline to release pressure by acting as a passing option. He is excellent at moving the ball. He can carry the ball forward with his surging runs. Alphonso Davies moves to the left-wing providing width on the left side. **Thomas Muller** plays as a second striker and joins **Robert Lewandowski** who plays as a forward. **Leon Goretzka** joins in the attacking transition, he plays in a crucial role where he is the passer and also the architect of Bayern Attack in Zone 14. 

# PSG

 PSG started the Semi-Final against Leipzig in a 4-3-3 formation, switching up from the usual 4-2-2-2. The team will be charged up after a good performance in a comfortable victory against Leipzig in the semi-finals. With **Marquinhos** as a DMF and **Kimpembe &amp; Thiago Silva** at the back, stability in the defense will be a key for PSG. **Di Maria** and **Neymar** are expected to be in the winger role. **Mbappe** would have the roles to convert the chances into goals upfront. PSG will have a big boost in **Verratti** returning from injury and might be starting in the biggest game of his club career so far in place of Herrera. Also, Keylor **Navas** is expected to start after gaining match-fitness.

2020-08-19,"Bayern are having their dream run this season. They already won Bundesliga this season and putting up a great performance in Champion's League. Their attack is one of the best in the whole of Europe and they have the capability of outscoring opponents. one of my friends tried to put up a [**tactical analysis**] of how **Bayern** can line up before the match.

With Possession

Bayen likes to dominate possession and Lyon will allow them to do so. Both of their fullbacks are excellent ballplayers. They can play the ball perfectly for the midfielders and forwards. **Thiago Alacantara** drops in front of the backline to release pressure. He is excellent at moving the ball. He can move the ball towards attack. In between two fullbacks **Alphonso Davies** is more attacking. He moves to the left-wing providing width on the left side. **Thomas Muller** though starts in attacking midfield position. But he plays as a second striker and joins **Robert Lewandowski** as a forward. **Leon Goretzka** joins in the attack, he plays in a free role and roams in zone 14 areas.

Without Possession

Without possession, Bayern likes to press high. Their defence is a bit weak. So they like to compensate them with pressing from the front. They use press both as a part of defending and attacking. Their forwards not only like to press the defenders but they also like to use their body to block the passing lanes. The midfield likes to mark 1v1 with the opponent and force them to play to the wing.

2020-08-14,"This match is going to be awesome,but i am not sure who will win.So Bayern is in very good shape and they are playing very attacking football and it will be hard for Barca to defend against them and also Barcas defense is not very good lately and Bayern has goal machine Lewandowski.Yea it is more logical to think that Bayern will win but Barcelona also can reach semi finals.For Barca it is good that there is only one match because in one match luck can play bigger role.And of course Barcas biggest hope have been,still is and will be Lionel Messi who can do unbelievable things.So i am not sure who will win but i hope Barca will😂😂Fc Barcelona Vs Bayern Munich",,1

2020-08-09,"This year, I'm heading towards bayern because it's probably the strongest squad this year, along with  City and Lewandowski is just really on form and can change the course of the game, as well as Davies and Gnabry etc, can also play really well. Messi is unpredictable but this year, I think it's bayern's year.
There's Man city too who have the second best chance in terms of winning after Bayern, Barcelona placing third for me. Atletico and PSG are both great clubs with phenomenal talent but I can't see them winning the tournament. Lyon and Leipzig can also do a miracle but these are my predictions.

2020-08-09,"Goal + Assist prediction for the 10 and 9.. 
If Messi shows the same sparkle, he can strip Bayern defence. Meanwhile Barca defence is not that great.. So both goalposts will be bustling..

Nuer and Stegan will have hell of a game... Time to prove which German is the best.

Thoughts?Messi vs Lewandowski",,1
2020-08-09,"With each remaining round of the Champions League for this season being played at a neutral ground in Lisbon and in one leg instead of over two, will the away goals rule still be applied to which ever team is considered the away team? I didn’t see anything on UEFA’s list of rule changes about the away goals rule, so I’m just looking for confirmation that its been removed for the rest of the competition.Away Goals rule for the rest of this years tourney?",,1
2020-08-09,"Wow..That's what this seasons's CL is..amazing and the only thing keeping me sane..

My predictions for the QFs are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Atalanta v Paris

The Leg at Italy might be interesting..given Atalanta's current form

\- expect a 3-2 victory for PSG at the Gewiss Stadium

\- my second prediction for this is actually could end in Atalanta's favour 2-1

&amp;#x200B;

The Leg at the Parc des Princes should decide it

\- If Atalanta lead, then I have a feeling..they might look to extend the lead which could pave way for PSG making a comeback

\- My prediction: 4-3 or 2-1, A Neymar Masterclass and a night to remember

2. Barcelona vs Bayern Munich

By far the most interesting QF to watch..would've been lovely if they both played in the final

\- Given the Current state at Barca..I'm expecting them to put on a tough fight across both legs but I believe B'Liga Winners Bayern Munich and Lewandowski would prevail

Predictions

\- Leg at Camp Nou - 1-1 draw or 2-1 in favour of Bayern (Messi might flip the scorecards)

\- Leg at the Allianz Arena - 3-2 Expecting a Lewandowski Hat-trick, Messi might prove to be the Trump card yet again.

&amp;#x200B;

So, My prediction:

Bayern would come on top with a 4-3 Aggregate victory or a 3-3 Aggregate Victory with more Away Goals

&amp;#x200B;

3. Leipzig vs A'Madrid

Boring Plan and Simple

\- This would be the most boring game..not only because of the way Diego Simeone plays but also since RB have lost their main man Timo Werner

\- My prediction: Atletico Madrid to come out on top with a 1-0 win on both legs..if not at 1-1 draw at the Red Bull Arena and a 1-0 win for A'Madrid at the Wanda.

&amp;#x200B;

Predictions - Atletico Madrid would prevail with a 2-1 or 2-0 win on aggregate

&amp;#x200B;

4. Man City vs Lyon

On One hand you have a team just off the back off beating Real Madrid and on the another a team that has just cruised past Ronaldo

\- Although it sounds like an easy prediction..given Man City's defensive woes, I've a feeling this could get interesting..Man City has an exciting and experienced team while Lyon has some decent youngsters..my prediction would be:

&amp;#x200B;

\- First Leg at the Etihad - 2-1 Man City will win courtesy of Jesus and Sterling while Depay's late goal would give hope for Lyon

\- Second Leg at Lyon's Stadium - 2-1 in the favour of Lyon (Penalties City win)

Sounds like a very bizzare prediction here but I believe Lyon have enough fire power and energy to level it after early goals by Bernado Silva, Depay and Aouar would level before Extra Time (if there's any ..it would be a win for City) while if there's penalities Lyon might have the chance of prevailing but City are the favourites

&amp;#x200B;

So the 4 teams I think will make it through are Bayern,A'Madrid,Man City,PSG

Hello guys, i dont know if this was already posted here, but I was wondering what was your opinion of the UCL badge of honor, that only some clubs are allowed to use.

If you guys dont know what I am talking about, it is the badge on the left sleeve that count how many UCL´s a club has. The only clubs that get to use it are the ones with +5 wins, or with 3 UCL´s in a row, therefore, the only clubs that have it are: Bayern Muchen, Real Madrid, Liverpool, Barça, Ajax and Milan.

In my opinion every club that has won the UCL in the past should use one, even if they won it only once, because to win a UCL is a motive of pride, especially in the teams that won it only once or twice.

2020-07-22,"Little bit of a rant about PSG.

Every post i see about them has comments stating they have no match fitness and no competitive matches for 4 months. Which is completely untrue. PSG not only have 4 friendlies that they have played, BUT also two cup finals. And call me out, but in my opinion two cup finals are going to be much more competitive than any league game. 4 friendlies and two competitive matches should discount the whole argument of no match fitness. Bayern will not have played a competitive match in over a month, should we suddenly discount them as being favourites?

And this is the first year on many that Neymar will be fit. As their playmaker and the most expensive player in the world, it will make a huge difference. Its like taking Messi away from Barca.

And i also see so many arguments about their defense? They dont have the best defence in the world, but they have the best defensive record in the champions league this season against a dortmund team which arguably have one of the most exciting offensive team this year, and against Real Madrid. If that alone doesnt show the extent of their defensive capabilities then i dont know what will. 

Atalanta have been incredible this season, but i can see PSG crushing their defence. Ill call a 4-2 to PSG.

2020-03-29,"**Euro 2020 Will Occur In December 2020, Massive Change To European Season Thank To New Corona Virus NCOV**

The good new for everybody is that the Euro 2020 football tournament still occur and will happen in December 2020. You do not call it 2020 tournament if it was not happen in 2020, stop all the non-sense stupid decision.

The new corona virus NCOV COVID19 is a great opportunity to change and fix what is was wrong in life !

Do you know there is a big flaw in the name of Football European Season like Champion League?

Example: You do not call Champion League 2018-2019 but you take the result of the national season started from 2017 !

The Champion League and Europa League like the “next stage” of a season, you cannot treat it like a commercial tournament any more.

The best change they should make is that start the new season from January/February to September/October.

Leave the November/December for any international tournaments like Euro, World Cup.

I remind you guys that World Cup 2022 was schedule happen in December as well.

So it is a great change for all Euro Club if the Euro 2020 could be held in December 2020, and new season start in Jan/Feb instead of August like now.

They can have 1 month summer break in between season for any kind of tournament/transfer window, etc.

So you can have English Premier League, Bundesliga, La liga 2021 start and finish in 2021, and next UEFA Champion League season will be called 2021-2022 like what is suppose to be.

It just some idea and solution I give you guys, the change is up each nation.

**For the Euro 2020 information:**  
 I can reveal that I am already holding the cure &amp; solution for this legendary beast NCOV, and the problem will be solved before the October 2020. I only need 30 days to save everybody with a “right” public uncensored platform condition.

The Euro 2020 tournament will start from December 1st 2020 and the final match will occur on Christmas day December 25th 2020.

I do not want to reveal more information unless the Government, UEFA, FIFA totally surrender and willing listen to me.

If you guys want to see Euro 2020 happen in December 2020 with the final match on Christmas Day, then please share the site **theworld.data.blog** to your government, authorities and your friends.

All I need is just a fair condition to release the cure for the new corona virus NCOV to the public.

Have Fun !  
 Best Regard,

2020-02-17,"Dortmund Vs PSG
Aggregate Result: 2-4
Think this game will have goals, but I think PSG have more motivation than ever to not screw up their chances. Their attack looks at full force and they’ll overwhelm Dortmund. (Sancho and co will respond w a few goals, but it won’t be enough.)

Liverpool Vs Atletico 
Aggregate result: 2-0
Think there won’t be much goals in this one, Liverpool will struggle to break Atleti down but will get past them at the end of the line.

Atalanta Vs Valencia
Aggregate result: 2-1
Hoping for Atalanta to keep being dark horses in this tournament, and I’ll go with my heart for this one.


Tottenham Vs RB Leipzig 
Aggregate result: 2-2 (Tottenham advance on away goals)
This is one of the hardest ones to predict as Leipzig have been insane in the league this year and have amazing quality, I do think Tottenham and Mourinho have a cutting edge Leipzig Dont. They could scrap it out.

Chelsea vs Bayern Munich 
Aggregate result: 1-3
Bayern love playing in London, and they are clear favorites in this tie. A few months ago it would’ve been harder to predict with Chelsea’s form, but now with Bayern on fire and Chelsea’s form dwindling this is my prediction. Bayern have more experience, too.

Napoli Vs Barcelona
Aggregate result: 1-5
Barcelona have a lot to prove and a weakened Napoli side could be perfect for them to blow up on.

Real Madrid Vs Manchester City
Aggregate result: 2-3
Think this’ll be very close, but the one reason I’m putting city ahead is that this means far more for them. The league is beyond their hands now, and a 2 year UCL ban could mean that by the time they’re back they would have lost their best assets. They’ll give everything. Madrid will fight back, though.

2019-12-18,"Essentially, the question I asked myself was this: ""*How much value is this player going to provide towards winning the game during any given CL matchup?""* I determined value by both **current form, proven consistency** &amp; **CL experience**. I did not consider things like personality, chemistry with manager, etc. because I'm ranking these players in a vacuum. In essence, ""Who would I want on my CL team and in what order?"" I omitted players that are likely not to play due to injuries/legal issues, etc. For players that are dealing with something nagging, I'm assuming full health for the list.

So, this is obviously subjective, and I would rather hear ***why*** you disagree and ***why*** someone is the most out of order instead criticism without meaning. I just think it'd be cooler to have a discussion on something subjective than simple agree/disagree comments. And to the list...

2019-06-12,I think that Man City are finally going to read through their European ceiling and take it home.Early predictions for next years winner?,,1
2019-06-02,"First of all, kudos to Liverpool for winning the Champions League, they deserved a trophy this year. THIS IS ONLY BASED ON THEIR SEASON PERFORMANCE. NOT THE UCL FINAL.

&amp;#x200B;

The match was an absolute crapshow. The penalty after 23 seconds wasn't even checked. The ball hit Sissoko's chest and then his arm, which he was holding up to point to an area for a teammate to cover. If there's VAR, why don't you use it?!! It was clearly something to be checked. Starting next season (2019/2020) any ball that hits an arm above the head will be penalised. BUT IT'S STILL THIS SEASON. 2019. The penalty completely ruined the whole game as Liverpool played defensively, trying not to concede. Which is fair. But so early in the game, completely killed the atmosphere. Both teams tried to avoid a counter attack for the entirety of the first half, in which no one did shit. Nothing. It took a pitch invader to turn heads to the TV, that's how boring it was. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second half was better but the 2' penalty continued to have an effect. We all know what happened. Tottenham had chances (which they blew), Tottenham finally woke up in the last 20 minutes, Origi scored (3 shots all UCL tourney, 3 goals), and the Scousers went mad. Eriksen pulled the best out of Allison, forcing a fine save. Son had a good strike but missed a header (bruh moment). At the end of the day, the Red Scousers won. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at the stats now, shall we?

&amp;#x200B;

Tottenham Hotspur and then Liverpool respectively

&amp;#x200B;

Shots: 16 - 14 (Not bad, just most of the shots were crap)

On Target: 8 - 3 (What a Spurs thing to do)

Possession 65 - 35 (A result of Liverpool playing a total crapshow in the first half. C'mon we all want to have some fun)

Pass Accuracy: 80% - 64% (If you play like that and win the UCL, how are we supposed to teach kids that good passing is important in football)

Fouls: 5 - 6 (Another result of everyone playing too cautiously, preventing counters)

Bookings (and Sending offs): 0 - 0 (Fair play??? Nope, there were some really stupid challenges not called. Take Rose's hit that led to Eriksen's free kick. No contact on the ball, painful hit on the knee/thigh)

Offsides: 3 - 2 

Corners: 8 - 9 (What happened to Llorente I thought he was tall like Peter Crouch)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The stats say it. Tottenham played a better game. They had more shots on target, MUCH more possession, and created more quality chances. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was a crappy final that was painful to watch. It wasn't glorious, but maybe part of the reason had to do with the hype. After the semifinals, the anticipation completely blew over and left everyone disappointed that they bothered to watch the final. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the bright side, Allison played like a brick wall. Crucial saves against Son and Eriksen. He had a very fine match. Virgil Van Dijk too ofc. No one could get past him (the closest was Son but Van Dijk caught up to him and poked the ball away so it technically doesn't count as ""successful""). Toby Alderweireld was, up to the Origi goal, the rock of the Spurs defence. He worked his heart out there, clearing balls, winning headers, the whole lot. Son Heung-Min led Tottenham's attack and continued to show us why everyone loves him. 

&amp;#x200B;

In summary:

### Slovenian referee Damir Skomina will take charge of next month's Champions League final between Liverpool and Tottenham.

The 42-year-old previously refereed Manchester United's Europa League final win over Ajax in 2017, as well as Chelsea's 4-1 defeat by Atletico Madrid in the 2012 Super Cup.

He was the first referee to send off an England goalkeeper when he showed Robert Green a red card in a 1-0 defeat in Ukraine in 2009.

Skomina will be assisted by his countrymen Jure Praprotnik and Robert Vukan, while the fourth official will be Antonio Mateu Lahoz from Spain.

Dutchman Danny Makkelie helms the VAR team, assisted by Pol Van Boekel, Felix Zwayer and Mark Borsch.

2019-04-11,"**Messi fans when Messi has a good game:** 

&amp;#x200B;

""definitely contender for the GOAT""

""one of the best of our generation""

""so grateful to be able to watch such a talent""

&amp;#x200B;

**Ronaldo fans when Ronaldo has a good game:**

&amp;#x200B;

""last time Messi scored a quarter-final goal in the 82nd minute while its raining: Cruyff was dead""

&amp;#x200B;

""Leogay Pessidog will never be anything close to Ronaldo""

&amp;#x200B;

""Best player in history no question"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I've noticed that there is an underlying difference between Messi fans and Ronaldo fans. Messi fans are appreciative of all he has done for the football world, he has shown that the game can be brought to new levels. While Ronaldo fans take a defensive approach and discredit everything that Messi has done just because he doesn't perform in very specific scenario's such as quarter-finals in the UCL. Just a year ago today, Messi and Ronaldo held the same number of UCL trophies which is a huge accomplishment for both players. Messi fans are memorized and solely stick to praising him. While on the other hand, Ronaldo fans take to slandering Messi and pointing out that his team carried him to all 4 trophies while Ronaldo had plenty, if not more backup at Manchester United and Real Madrid (e.x. Rooney, Nani, Giggs, Tevez, and at Real he had Ramos, Bale, Marcelo, and Modric). My interest in the taking sides and debate over who is the GOAT has shrunk due to the toxicity mainly on the Ronaldo side. If you think I'm being biased, go to the CL or BRFootball twitter or instagram accounts and look at the comments under the posts related to either Ronaldo or Messi. Of course there is still the ""Penaldo"" name being thrown around but I haven't seen it in years now and it's nothing compared to what ""die hard"" Ronaldo fans call Messi, it's a disgrace to both players.Messi vs. Ronaldo Fans",,1

2018-12-12," **Former** **Tottenham manager** **Tim Sherwood** **says** [**Manchester United**] **rivals are in with a shot.**

For a second successive year, all of the Premier League sides competing in Europe’s top club competition have reached the knockout stages after Tottenham and Liverpool sealed their places on a nervy Tuesday night.

Both Manchester United and Manchester City have already confirmed their progression to the last 16 and could claim top spot in their respective groups on Wednesday night.

With United seemingly in a constant state of crisis, the ex-Blackburn midfielder says a first European title since 2008 is out of their reach.

“Can one of the Premier League teams win it? I think they can,” Sherwood told Talksport.

“You’ve got the three Premier League sides – Manchester City, Liverpool, and Tottenham – PSG will be a threat with their firepower, Juventus obviously, and then you’ve got the two giants from Spain – Barcelona and Real Madrid.

“Manchester United can’t win,"" he continued.

“I’m talking about the Champions League and at the moment you’d have to say on form and the way they’re playing they’ve got no chance of winning.”Tim Sherwood says Man Utd have no chance of winning Champions League! Premier League trio in the hunt for Euro glory",,1
2018-12-12," 

Harry Kane said Tottenham’s performance at Barcelona was the latest evidence that they can live with Europe’s best and should fire the belief they can progress deep into the [Champions League].

Spurs drew 1-1 at Camp Nou on Tuesday to advance to the last 16, because Internazionale could only draw 1-1 at home to PSV Eindhoven. Tottenham had needed to match Inter’s result to go through. “Thank us later Spurs,” PSV’s account tweeted, with a winking emoji.

Tottenham trailed to Ousmane Dembélé’s seventh-minute goal but created a fistful of chances, most of which came in a dominant second-half and, when Kane teed up the substitute, Lucas Moura, for the equalizer on 85 minutes, it was no more than they deserved.

Barcelona – already qualified as group winners – had rested regulars such as Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Sergio Busquets.

Spurs enjoyed similarly positive performances in away ties last season, most notably in the 1-1 draw at Real Madrid and the 2-2 draw at Juventus. They had been widely written off after taking only one point from their opening three ties this season and Kane felt their response, starting with the Wembley wins over PSV and Inter and culminating at Camp Nou, showed their character.

“It’s another step forward,” Kane said. “It’s a massive achievement for the club but it’s important we carry it on and go as far as we can in this competition. This will give us believe we can do that. The way we played and the chances we created – it shows we can be as good as anyone on our day.

2018-12-10," 

The bid to reach the knockout stages of the [Champions League] reaches its climax this week with Inter Milan, Paris Saint-Germain, and Liverpool among seven clubs sweating on securing one of the remaining four places in the last 16.

The matches, scheduled for Wednesday morning (AEDT), include a number of blockbuster encounters as Liverpool hope for one of those magical European nights at Anfield against Napoli in Group C, while Inter will be relying on Group B winners Barcelona to do them a favor and see off Tottenham Hotspur.

 

Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, sitting third in the group on six points behind PSG (eight) and leaders Napoli (nine), must win to have any chance of progressing, while the Serie A side needs just a draw at Anfield to guarantee their spot in the next round.

Napoli could even lose and still go through if PSG loses to Red Star Belgrade.

Should Neymar and company prevail in Serbia, Liverpool would need to win 1-0 or by two goals or more to pip Napoli on head-to-head record. Liverpool's Egypt striker Mo Salah certainly looks capable of having scored a superb hat-trick at Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday.

If Napoli, PSG, and Liverpool all finish on nine points, the Merseyside club would finish top with second place determined by the scoreline at Anfield.

  

A group stage exit for PSG would be humiliating for new manager Thomas Tuchel given the club's Qatari owners' desperation to see the French champions conquer Europe.

They have reached the knockout stages of the Champions League in every season since 2012-13, but have never gone on to reach the final.

After claiming one point from their first three matches in Group B, Tottenham looked out of contention before consecutive wins against PSV Eindhoven and Inter mean they head to the Nou Camp in second place knowing a win will guarantee them a place in the last-16 for the third time.

Luciano Spalletti's Inter side, level with Tottenham on seven points but below them on head-to-head, lost 1-0 to Serie A leaders Juventus on Friday but will be heavy favorites at home to bottom side PSV who have just one point from seven matches in the Champions League this season.

Tottenham lost 4-2 against Barcelona in the home leg at Wembley, but may have an advantage in the fact Barca have already qualified as group winners and may take a leisurely approach as they wind down for the mid-season break.

Mauricio Pochettino's team also do not necessarily need a win, as merely matching Inter's result will do.

Then on Thursday (AEDT), Lyon and Shakhtar Donetsk face each other in the final showdown for a last 16 place in Group F.

The French side sits second on seven points, two ahead of the Ukrainians and so only need a draw to qualify.

 

Shakhtar must get maximum points to seal their fifth appearance in the competition's round of 16.

The 12 teams already qualified for the knockout stages are Ajax, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Manchester City, Manchester United, Porto, Real Madrid, Roma and Schalke 04.

However, only Barca, Porto and Real have clinched top spot in their respective groups.Liverpool, Inter and PSG sweating on Champions League last-16 spots",,1
2018-12-10," 

Winning against Barcelona at Camp Nou is not easy, and that is what Tottenham Hotspur may have to do in the end on Tuesday evening to progress to the last-16 stage of the Champions League this season.

Tottenham will go through if they draw with Barcelona in Spain and Inter Milan lose to PSV in Italy, but it is unlikely that the Italian giants will drop all three points against the already-eliminated Dutch club at home.

 

To be on the safe side, despite being second in the group at the moment due to a superior head-to-head record with Inter, [Spurs] should be going for the win at Camp Nou, and one suspects that manager Mauricio Pochettino will be preparing his players with that mindset.

Tottenham’s chances of winning will have been boosted by the fact that Barcelona has already won the group and gone through to last 16.

 

The North London club will also feel relieved that Luis Suarez will miss the match due to a knee injury and Lionel Messi is doubtful - a further boost to their chances of going through.

Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde told Eurosport: “I'll make a change or two tomorrow, there'll be players with knocks like Luis Suarez who I wasn't planning on asking to play two games in a row to give him a rest.

&amp;#x200B;

[""You'll see tomorrow when the lineup] is announced if Lionel Messi plays, but the important thing is that whoever is selected goes out onto the pitch motivated because they'll come up against a side playing for their future.”

Thanks to everyone who's been active on r/championsleague since I became a moderator.

As you know I've made several changes to the sub including changing the design on desktop (including adding content to the sidebar), setting up minimum karma rules, banning a lot of spam users and setting up automoderator for spam stream links.

Unfortunately a few other questional spammers are still getting through, some for illegal streams and some for betting websites, some people even begging for likes on their own instagram posts. 

To try and combat this further and to ensure r/championsleague is an enjoyable, reliable and safe community, I want to setup a website whitelist which will mean only links from these certain websites can be posted to this sub. 

This will practically eliminate any potentially unsafe streaming sites, any dodgy betting sites etc. 

Can you please help me out and advise any websites which you think should be whitelisted, especially if there are some that are primarily read outside of the UK, local newspapers or club/fan websites themselves which I won't be aware of. 

So far the list is as follows:

2018-04-30,"Pep Guardiola said: ""You can win the Champions League in seven games. The league is 10 months. I'm sorry, the league is much more important."" Also PSG said they were unlucky they had to play against Real Madrid when for example Bayern played Besiktas. Or Manchester United had two bad days against Sevilla.

Let’s address all this by having a few changes:

Instead of 8 groups x 4 teams have 6 x 4 (the best of the best)
Winners of each group will qualify for the next phase. The best four runners-up will play eliminatory matches home/away and the two winners will qualify for the next phase.
Next we have 2 groups of 4 teams (the very best of the best).

In 2018 we might have had:

Group A: Juventus, Sevilla, Manchester City, Bayern Munich

Group B: Real Madrid, Liverpool, Barcelona, Roma

**Just imagine the matches!**

Semifinals The winner of each group will play the runner-up of the other group. The winners can choose where to play the first game (home or away) to add more incentive of winning the group.

I have started to lose hope of the european football where you can't get anywhere unless you hav a rich asian on your ship.

I'm not really much of a Champions League viewer, I try to watch the final, but it often gets lost in the shuffle.  I'm an MLS fan :\), feel free to flame if you need to.

Anyhow, I noticed tonight while watching CCL that the UEFA CL final is in Kiev.  Turns out I'll be in Kiev for like the 5 days prior to the game, but not game day.  

Is the UCL final just a one day event where the teams show up early and just train?  Or is it like the Superbowl where there's a week's worth of events prior to it?  I'm assuming most of Europe will be dead soccer\-wise outside of this, so seeing a Ukrainian league game is not in the cards I guess.

2017-02-21,"Let's be honest Sevilla vs Leicester is not the marquee matchup when it comes to the round of 16. When fans think about the UCL they think of two European powerhouses going head to head like Barca vs PSG or last years Madrid derby final. Compared to those Sevilla vs Leicester may seem like an afterthought but this matchup has more than meets the eye.

In La Liga, all other teams are shadowed by 2 world powers of football, Real Madrid and Barcelona, with Atletico slowly catching up. This means unless you're a fan of Sevilla you probably didn’t know they’ve quietly been having a fantastic season! They currently sit behind reigning champions Barcelona in 3rd place along with being 4 points ahead of 4th place Atletico. You're probably trying to think of their best player right now...or any player for that matter.

You would think with the sale of on fire frenchmen Kevin Gameiro, Sevilla would've taken a step back. They happened to do the exact opposite, they retooled the roster with the singings of Wissam Ben Yedder, Luciano Vietto and the loan deals of Samir Nasri and Stevan Jovetic. Although they made all these attacking acquisitions many people felt Sevilla do to what they always do which is finish top 6 and look forward to next season’s Europa League. The outcome has turned out different than expected, they  have turned heads this season with wins over Real Madrid, Atletico and Valencia. Carrying momentum from their league success Sevilla has been able too advance to the round of 16 in the UCL. Not only that but they may have gotten the best draw possible with Leicester City. Last season facing Leicester may have struck some fear in their opponents but I think this season Sevilla should be looking forward to beating the already demoralised Foxes.

I know this is starting to seem like bashing Leicester is a constant theme in my blogs but they obviously haven’t read my writing for motivation since they continue to disappoint! Their horrible season continues as they most recently lost to League 1 side Millwall in the FA cup. Although I keep hoping for Leicester to turn it around and avoid the humiliation of going from champions to relegation I just don’t think it'll happen. They continue to play like it doesn't matter to any of them, I don’t know if there was too much partying this summer, or the loss of Kante working his ass off every game rubbed off, but whatever the problem may be something has to change!

Many people think manager Claudio Ranieri has lost the trust of his players and should be let go, i'm starting to agree with that idea. With the Foxes focused on a relegation battle in the Premier League the UCL should be the least of their worries. Although it would be nice put a quarter final run on their CV, staying up and being able to keep your best players is the most important thing right now. All in all I think they will give the 2nd squad a chance and rest their stars but you never know.

With all that being said, Leicester may be in the better league BUT Sevilla are the better team and I have great faith that they will show that tomorrow night! Not to mention their at home so I say you can count the Foxes out of this one.

2017-02-14,"The Champions League is back this week! Do I need to say more? Well I will either way! One of the marquee matchups to kick off the round of 16 this week is Arsenal vs Bayern Munich. The German giants have yet again looked hard to stop this season and the Champions League has been no different. The Gunners have also seen a lot of the same this season, they were expected to challenge for a title but have failed keep up with probable champions Chelsea. No matter if you're a fan of either team, I know one thing that’s got me excited, Champions League being back!

We have the same conversation about the Gunners every season and they never seem to be listening. I don’t even consider myself an Arsenal fan and I am continually disappointed by their constant underachieving. I can’t even imagine what it must be like being an ACTUAL FAN. The Gunners have some quality in their side but over the years questionable acquisitions have kept them from reaching the peak of English football once again. My list could go for miles but i'll just give you a few of the shockers in the last 10 years… Andre Santos, Marouane Chamakh, Andre Arshavin, Park Chu Young and Denilson just to name a few. Im sure you all know the saying “make the best of what you have” and In Arsenal’s case you can’t blame all of their recent shortcomings on their bad transfer choices, but that certainly hasn't helped! This has all created a long title drought for the gunners and a different level of confidence compared to the Invincible's run in the early 2000”s. Now enough about the past, even though the Gunners won 2-0 at the weekend inconsistency has plagued the Gunners this season and facing a juggernaut like Bayern Munich won’t make starting a winning streak any easier.

While the Gunners have been underperforming this season, Bayern Munich have been doing exactly what you would expect them to do! Contending for a Bundesliga title while fielding a team of international superstars. While they may not be as dominant as the Pep years this season, they're still 7 points clear at the top the league and look to go for the double with the Champions League trophy in sight as well. Although their season so far would be considered great for most other teams in the world. Most other teams haven’t experienced the success they've been used to for the past 4 years or so. Even though the squad has remained pretty much unchanged from last season, something’s different for Bayern this season. Long time captain Philipp Lahm has decided to retire at the end of the season and forgo the last season of his contract which was a shocking blow to the Bayern faithful. With that shock it’s a sign that things are changing at Bayern and yes I know the winning will continue but with RB Leipzig on their tail it won’t be certainty that Bayern will be destined for the title in the next couple of seasons.  

With all that said I forgot to mention Bayern are at home for the first leg, so that right there sways my prediction. Bayern are too good at home to bet against and that's why they will top the Gunners 3-1!

My point of view as a south-american outsider: This sucks. As if it wasn't annoying enough that Real Madrid and Barcelona have won the last 5 out of 10 editions, now people want to make it more difficult for interesting, ""emerging"" teams like Leicester and Hertha Berliner, plus the ones that are doing better than these giants this season like Tottenham, Napoli and Fiorentina to play in world's most attractive football tournament.

2021-09-26,"As a Manchester United fan this is gonna hurt a lot but it needs to be said. The hard truth is that Ole is a manager who has won 0 trophies, has struggled and continues to struggle in cup competitions, and whose literal only claim to fame is a measly 2nd place finish to a Man City team that was 12 POINTS clear of Manu. 

What Ole has brought in terms of feelings and culture has been great almost refreshing to the nightmare of Mourinho and co, but let’s not kid ourselves we haven’t accomplished anything. 

Ole just got knocked out in the THIRD ROUND of a cup we should be expecting to win to west hams reserve team. Every single one of our major rivals made it through this round. 

Ole also just lost a CL match to Young Boys.

Ole barely managed to beat west hams team in the league without their top goal scorer (Antonio) and struggled against teams like Southampton. And we are expected to keep a form that will magically keep us at the top of the league?

As for the loss to Villa at Old Trafford alot of people blamed Greenwood for his selfishness in the final third but ultimately that goes back to the coaching. Ole saw Greenwood's selfishness and did nothing, didn't shout at him at the touch line, didn't correct him at half time based on the second half performance, didn't sub him off, he just sat there and watch. Personally I think he was waiting for Greenwood to bail us out again with individual brilliance.

Just literally watch the way liverpool, city, and Chelsea play. It’s really not rocket science why they get consistent results and it doesn’t take much in fancy tactical talk to notice a difference in how they dictate matches. They may struggle from time to time and have to grind out results but that’s usually more due to injuries and fatigue than anything. 

We literally are grinding out results at the beginning of the season with a relatively fit squad. 

What happens if Bruno gets injured? Varane gets injured? Greenwood? 

What can anyone say about Ole that make doubters sure he is fit? The simple fact is Ole finished 20th with Cardiff and couldn’t win the Norwegian league with molde and now he's supposed to magically pull a champions league or prem? That's delusionalManchester United will win nothing with Ole as the manager",,0

2021-09-26,"When you have the right players, it can work wonders. The current United squad is practically built for counter attacking football. There's a reason why, even in the league that had arguably the greatest side in history in Pep's Barca, Mourinho's Real Madrid hold the record for goals in a season. If Mourinho had this current United squad instead of the one he actually had, he would be challenging for everything. 

And not for nothing but the style of football being good under Ole isn't even true, it's just a squad stacked with quality so it sometimes finds it's way through. And it's still mostly just Bruno. Under a real manager that could be there consistently.United fans who turn their nose up at ""defensive"" football are just stupid",,0

2021-09-25,"I know last season United, for some reason, had immense troubles beating and sometimes even just getting a draw against bottom half of the table clubs. This was a trend last season that to put it bluntly annoyed the hell out of me, and it is starting to look like that's what's happening this season too. United have made significant improvements in certain areas of the pitch but it just seems that as of right now, until they can get someone top notch to sit in front of the defense the club is screwed. I've been so disappointed during the last 3 games that I've chosen to take a nap at half....United have some problems to fix.Too early to give up hope?",,0

However, they're not even close to being a ""top 6"" club, which is generally defined by the fan base and global reach of a club.

2021-09-24,"One thing I have noticed is that people tend to assume City fans are plastic because they ""don't have history"" but this is false because 1. City had one of the highest average attendences in English football even before the takeover and even when they were relegated to the 3 league. 2. City has had about the same season ticket holders ratio to Man United since 2003. In 2003 City sold 17k season tickets and United sold 27k. To put this in perspective FC Barcelona sells more than 3 times as many season tickets as Espanyol. I am not saying City don't have plastic fans because they have but most people who tend to call City fans plastic and glory hunters are not better themselves.

2021-09-24," Chelsea are already making their presence known in the 2021/22 [Premier League],  as they sit top of the table heading into this weekend's fixtures. Man  City provide the opposition on Saturday lunchtime and given the recent  results between the two clubs, Guardiola has plenty to be concerned  about this weekend.  

 

### Chelsea Draw No Bet

We're backing Chelsea with a draw no bet, meaning that if the home  side win the bet pays out but if the game were to end in a draw then we  would get our stake back. Chelsea have won four of their last five  encounters with Man City, including each of the duo's last three  encounters in the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. The  Londoners are yet to lose a league game this season, winning four times  and drawing once, while Man City have lost one and drawn one of their  opening five fixtures.

### Chelsea to Score First (No Goal, No Bet)

Not only are we confident that Chelsea will win, we're also backing  the home side to score first and if they were to be no goals in the  game, this bet would then see your stake returned. Of Chelsea's recent  victories over Man City, two have ended 1-0 and the other two have  finished 2-1 and in three of those four matches, Chelsea have scored the  first goal of the game.

### Over 2.5 Goals

Four of the last six meetings between Chelsea and Man City have  produced over 2.5 goals, and we're expecting another action-packed  90-minutes between the pair this weekend. Three of Chelsea's last six  outings have produced over 3.5 goals and in each of those games, the  Londoners have scored exactly three goals. Over 4.5 goals have been  scored in four of Man City's last six outings, so you can see just why  we're predicting goals on Saturday.

2.bruno Lage - can't score and has been conceding goals. Raul jiminez looks like a shadow of what he once did. Losing to 10 men Brentford shows me this team are in trouble 
3. Steve Bruce - Newcastle are in shambles and I can't see them staying up unless more investment is made or they change managers.

2021-09-21,"Taking the knee, while a lovely show of unity and support for the BLM movement following the protests and marches which have gone on over the last few years, is ultimately a cop out by the FA, UEFA and FIFA. Why? Because it doesn't cost them a penny, it is purely symbolic and displays 'we want racism out' with minimal cost and effort applied.

These three organisations only care about footballers in general for one very specific reason; they make them money. This couldn't be more obvious with their pushing for more fixtures and competitions; Europa Conference league? More money! More teams in the Champions league, more matches = more money. A world cup every two years (suggested)? More money! All the while the bloated fixture list is pushing the teams in them further and further, less time the players have for themselves and for their families.

If the FA cared about beating racism, then we would see more BAME referees and managers in the Premier league.
At the time of writing there has only ever been one non-white referee in the top tier of British football, Uriah Rennie. This is despite the FA commiting to achieving a 10% of BAME by 2016, which they failed at achieving. 
Currently there are only two non-white managers in the Premier League; Nuno and Patric Vieira. There are plenty of BAME ex-footballer players who not only would be ideal as managers, but aspire to it and are yet are overlooked.
Even in the other top leagues across Europe this trend is mirrored:

Ligue 1- 0 non-white managers.

Bundesliga- 0 non-white managers.

La liga- 0 non-white managers.

Serie A- 0 non-white managers.


UEFA's governing body itself is as diverse as a bag of imperial mints. 

President- Aleksander Čeferin, White.

First Vice President- Karl-Erik Nilsson, White

Vice Presidents- Zbigniew Boniek, Sándor Csányi, Luis Rubiales, Fernando Soares Gomes da Silva and Michele Uva, All White.

If FIFA, UEFA and the FA cared about 'kicking out racism' and more diversity in football, they would employ more BAME referees, have BAME representatives at a high level and encourage more BAME managers for teams. But the fact is they only care about the non-white players because they make them £££, €€€, $$$.

2021-09-21,"A surprisingly challenging thought experiment:

Build a 25 man squad for a premier league season, using at least 1 player from each team. That will give you a total of 20 players, so you may choose 2 player from 5 teams of your choice. (Hard Mode would be 2 from 5 teams outside last season’s top 4). You can choose any formation you’d like (I’ve gone for 4-3-3). You can choose how many you want in each area of pitch (I’ve gone 3-8-9-5).

Very interested to see the teams that people put together. 

My 25 man list

GK x 3
Martinez (Aston Villa)
Pope (Burnley)
Krul (Norwich)

DEF x 8
Shaw (Man Utd)
Van Dijk (Liverpool)
Konsa (Aston Villa)
Cancelo (Man City)
Tierney (Arsenal)
Coady (Wolves)
Ajer (Brentford)
Lamptey (Brighton)

MID x 9
Kante (Chelsea)
Fernandes (Man Utd)
De Bruyne (Man City)
Phillips (Leeds)
Tielemans (Leicester)
Bowen (West Ham)
Ward-Prowse (Southampton)
Eze (Crystal Palace)
Willock (Newcastle)

FWD x 5
Salah (Liverpool)
Lukaku (Chelsea)
Son (Tottenham)
Sarr (Watford)
Calvert-Lewin (Everton)

I doubled up with Aston Villa, Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City, Man Utd. You can also see that for some teams, I’ve not chosen arguably their best players (Toney, Zaha, Rice…), so once you try to put it on paper you’ll see it’s a deceptive challenge. There is potentially a 25 man squad without any of these players that would win the league in a head to head as well.

Sorry if advance if this is a bit of a dumb question, but I'm just unsure. Currently, Liverpool and Chelsea are drawn top of the table and both teams have a perfectly identical record (exact same points, goal difference and goals scored). 

What would happen if the season ends with both teams top of the league and with identical records? Would both teams need to play a playoff game to decide the title winner or is it decided on another statistic like yellow cards?

But my god, what Stuart Attwell and co were thinking, or rather not thinking, in the Brighton-Leicester game beggars belief.

1. The penalty given against Vestergaard in the first half. The on pitch referee who was closest gave a corner, the 4th official didn't have a clue and the linesman who was miles away immediately raised his flag for a foul. So obviously there's disagreement within the officiating team which needs to be cleared up, right? No, Stuart Atwell goes across to the lino, chats with him for a second and then gives a penalty without consulting his screen. It was clear as day that Vestergaard was getting fouled in my opinion.

2. The first of the two disallowed Leicester goals. I think out of all those decisions today, this might be the one where it's sort of understandable. Ball bounces all over the place before it's put in, Barnes was probably blocking the line of sight at some point in that play, if that is their argument.

3. I just can't wrap my head around the Ndidi header. Sanchez had a clear line of sight of the ball for every moment after Ndidi had headed the ball towards goal. I don't get what Barnes supposedly did wrong there. He's offside, yes, but hes not in any way shape or form interacting with play.

Maybe this is just me, but I'd appreciate if premier league referees were held accountable to some degree.Can we talk about the horrific refereeing that was put on display today?",,0

2021-09-19,"After a tumultuous 8 days Manchester united are facing off against West Ham in London. Already it seems to be shaping up to be a great bout however both sides have serious points to prove. 

Manchester united will be wanting to bounce back to the unfortunate loss to lose pesky young boys where they were handed a rather brutal loss in the dying seconds of the game. This wasn't just the 1 incident at the end of the game that led to the loss, obviously the red card to wan-bissaka was huge in the momentum of the game but also the pitch played a part in it too. I will never understand how its fair to play on a pitch that has to be flooded with water so its playable. Besides the point they will be looking to send a message to chealse and city with a win at West ham and hopefully a clean sheet to go with it. 

Doesn't mean that will happen tho because West ham have been playing very well under Davy Moyse  and are still to drop points this season. They are missing they're heavy hitters however with Antonio being suspended which is a real shame because he's been in such good form for them. Still doesn't mean Manchester united don't have their hands full because they're midfield is formidable and balanced in a way that Ole hasn't been able to achieve.

Which makes the importance for Manchester united to win this one even greater. With all the links with rice and lingards great 6 months there, it's a game that the papers will be all over and will start many narratives if it doesn't go the way it should for them.

With the champs only managing a draw against Southampton, which judging from they're past 4 games is the norm for Southampton. They will be looking to capitalise on this and hopefully put some extra pressure on Chealse for they're match against spurs later that day. If Manchester united have any desire to take the league back this season they're attitude will have to remain one of a relenting attacking spirit and mental fortitude when the game gets rolling.Time to take it personally?",,0

2021-09-19,"Hi everyone, American fan here who started following football passionately a few years ago, and I’m genuinely curious about some of the banter I’ve seen online about Manchester City and their fanbase.

I’ve followed the major American sports passionately my entire life; when I started following football, and especially the EPL, I started noticing that the things prioritized by fans, the trash talk, and the overall psychological aspects of fans differs quite a bit from how fans are in the states. The jokes made towards Man City the last few days really piqued my curiosity as I love analyzing this kind of stuff in relation to sports fandom.

Objectively, Man City is likely about the 5th most popular EPL club if based on quantifiable things like social media engagement, shirt sales, and TV ratings. If you expand this across Europe it’s hard to argue that they aren’t one of the 10 biggest clubs in the world, but if you based things off online perception, you would think they really have no fans.

I’m interesting in knowing if this is purely online banter (I get it, it’s Reddit), or if there’s genuine feelings that Man City are really that far behind United, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Arsenal in terms of popularity and “bigness.”

From my uneducated perspective it feels like fans of these “bigger” clubs are driven by a bit of jealousy in Man City’s recent success, and obviously we have that in American sports too, but it manifests itself differently. It also feels like there’s a bit of elitism from clubs with more of a history, whereas in American sports it’s much more about recent success. Is this more of a cultural thing?Genuine discussion about the Man City crowd from a newer EPL fan, not banter.",,0

What are the best ways I can learn such as books, documentaries, films, etc. I’ve never watched non Spanish commentary until now so where can I learn the most about the English commentators? I would like to fully engulf myself into learning as much as I can but the premier league is a foreign concept in the USA. CONCACAF leagues, La Liga, and Serie A reign supreme because that’s where all our national team players are so I’m very knowledgeable in those leagues but as I said I’d like to become more knowledgeable of the premier league.

**REVIEW BY MINUTES**

**5’:** First chance of the game, a lovely pass from halfway by Ruben Neves out wide to Marçal, who cuts inside and has a curling effort from outside the area, nowhere near really though, high and wide.

**8’:** Brentford score on their first chance, but it’s not going to count, Mbuemo is offside. He was played in down the right and pulled it back for Ivan Toney who finished well first time, but the flag did eventually go up.

**10’:** Oh Raul Jiménez that’s embarrassing. He’s down the left wing, and instead of playing a cross with his left, he’s tried to do a rabona cross, he’s half trod on the ball and fallen over! Goal kick.

**14’:** Speculative from Marçal. A Wolves corner is cleared out by Brentford, and it’s a bouncing ball over towards the full back who first time fires it at goal from 25-30 yards, it ends up trickling wide.

**17’:** Poor pass from Jansson as he gives it away at halfway to Trincão, who finds Traoré with a pass. Adama Traoré works some space at the edge but can only fire wide. It’s been almost all Wolves so far but they need a goal, Brentford have shown what they can do if they can get a counter attack going.

**22’:** Sloppy from Brentford and Wolves. Brentford finally get an attack going and Rico Henry was an extra man over on the left, and a pass towards him is loose and out for a goal kick. That goal kick is played short to Coady who gives it away to Sergi Canós high up the pitch, but his cross goes nowhere near anyone and out for another goal kick. Coady acknowledges the error.

**23’:** The game is starting to open up a little, but the last pass is lacking any quality. Wolves get about 25 yards out from Brentford’s goal again, and Jiménez tries to play a through ball, which just runs straight through to David Raya in the Brentford goal. The game is screaming for a moment of quality.

**26’:** Marçal is on some kind of tightrope here. The first Brentford corner is headed behind again by Neves, however during that Marçal has a tight grip on Ivan Toney. Second corner comes in and it’s a **PENALTY FOR BRENTFORD**! No prizes for guessing, it’s Marçal for pulling down Ivan Toney.

**27’: GOAL BRENTFORD!:** Easy as you like for Ivan Toney, who takes a slow two step walk up, and roles it into the bottom right corner, sending Sa the wrong way. Sa was actually booked pre-penalty for trying to rough up the penalty spot… that didn’t work well.

**29’:** Brentford score another but it’s ruled out again! Janelt is played through on goal and is denied well by Sa. It’s headed back in by Sergi Canós, Mbuemo misses it but Toney controls and backheels it in. However the ball has hit his arm when controlling it, so it’s ruled out. The Wolves defence is all over the place any time Brentford come forward.

**32’:** And now Wolves hit the crossbar! A long clearance up by Sa is headed down by Ajer but falls for Jiménez. He plays it into Traoré who cuts in and fires a thunderbolt towards goal, which takes a deflection off a Brentford defender and smacks off the bar and out. Henry with a top bit of defending too to prevent Trincão getting on the rebound.

**34’: GOAL BRENTFORD!:** This game has exploded into life and Brentford are 2-0 up. Raya kicks it long out of his hands to the left wing, where Toney out-muscles Max Kilman to get down the line. Kilman half recovers but Toney gets a nice bounce, continues down the line and squares it for Bryan Mbuemo to tap into the net. Brentford have attacked roughly 5 times and scored almost every time, whether allowed or not!

**38’:** A couple of Brentford players down so a brief breather in whats been a chaotic few minutes. Saïss is booked for a foul on Toney. The big difference between the 2 teams right now is defensively. Brentford look solid with their wingback system, but Wolves look very timid and wide open in their back 4. Marçal looks happier going forward, Kilman was turned by Toney for the 2nd goal, and Saïss and Coady just look like they want some help!

**43’:** Moving towards halftime and it’s looking reasonably comfortable for Brentford. They’re starting to get more comfortable on the ball, knowing they can take their time now. Both teams will want half time, just for very different reasons. Brentford as a benchmark for their 2-0 lead, Wolves to try and reset and make some alterations.

**45’:** What on earth is Saïss doing. Wolves start to work quite a way out from Brentford’s goal, but no patience from Saïss this time. He latches onto a bouncing ball a good 35 yards out and leathers it into the stands behind Raya’s goal. Silly effort really. 3 minutes added on in the first half.

**HALF TIME: WOLVES 0-2 BRENTFORD** It’s been such a professional performance so far from Brentford, one that doesn’t show a lack of experience at this level. Wolves have had a majority of the ball, but have created very little.

**HALF TIME’:** First half thoughts, the way Thomas Frank has set up Brentford for this one has been near-perfect, and the players have produced so far. The back 3 of Jansson, Pinnock and Ajer have looked calm and composed, there’s been a decent amount of defending for Henry and Canós to do but they’ve gotten forward into some good spaces too. Nørgaard will go un-noticed in that first half but his positioning has been superb in covering the back 3, and it’s allowed Baptiste and Janelt to create and move forward. Toney and Mbuemo are working really well together too, creating for each other.

&amp;#x200B;

**46’:** Half time change for Wolves, Saïss, who was on a yellow card, is replaced by the on loan forward Hwang Hee-Chan.

**46’:** Could have been 3! It’s so poor from Wolves, Sá plays out to Neves, who is slow and dis-possessed by Janelt. The ball comes to Mbuemo on the edge of the area who cuts inside and fires high and wide. Almost the worst possible restart from Wolves.

**47’:** Wolves quickly get down the other end, and Henry gives away a free kick down the right. That ball is swung in but is collected by Raya. A couple of Brentford defenders, Ajer and Jansson, are down on that one so a short break already 2 minutes into the half.

**50’:** Adama Traoré almost with a cross goal! He gets down the right side to the by-line, and chips a high ball across. It has Raya back pedalling as it looks like it’s going to drop in, but the spin and slight curl take it away before it can get down.

**55’:** What a run from Ajer! The centre back wins the ball and plays it off. He then charges down the right wing and receives it back. The pass is stretching him a little too far though and it ends up in a goal kick but the effort was impressive.

**56’:** Lovely chop skill move from Hwang Hee-Chan in the Brentford area to nutmeg Jansson, but his square ball across is cleared by the Bees, who still look solid as a team.

**58’:** Lovely flick by Toney and the ball comes to Baptiste charging through the middle. He’s cynically taken down from behind by Neves who receives a yellow card.

**59’:** And now Baptiste gets a yellow. Marçal clears the ball from the left side, and Baptiste slides in with studs up catching the Brazilian fullback, right under the assistant referee’s nose.

**61’:** Traoré is the obvious danger. He’s down the right again and flashes a ball across the area, but no Wolves player is in an advanced enough position to get onto it.

**64’: RED CARD BRENTFORD!** Baptiste was about to be subbed off for Onyeka, but that can’t happen anymore! Baptiste is sent off for a rugby style challenge on Trincão after losing the ball to him. That is potentially one of the stupidest second yellow cards you can see. Wolves needed something to go their way and this maybe it.

**66’:** Brentford make a change anyway. Onyeka is still coming on, but it’s now for Sergi Canós, who doesn’t look to impressed at all. This change happening after Jansson went down in the Brentford area off the ball, looked like it may have been a Wolves player catching him but he just slipped and stayed down!

**68’:** WHAT A TACKLE THAT IS! Kristoffer Ajer as good as scoring a goal for that one. The ball was swung into the Brentford box, a Wolves player chesting it down for Hwang Hee-Chan who just has to get his shot off, but Ajer lunges in with an amazing last ditch challenge.

**72’:** Wolves change, Marçal making way for Daniel Podence, Trincão potentially moving to left back.

**74’:** What in the hell is going on! The flag goes up against Wolves on a poorly worked short corner, but the game carries on! A mad scramble ensues whilst the flag is still up, and eventually Kilman fires wide and then the referee blows for the offside. Jansson complains to the ref and receives a yellow card for it… very bizarre. Brentford also make a change here, Rico Henry, who’s on a yellow, is taken off for Mads Roerslev.

**75’:** Break in play after a clash of heads involving Conor Coady and Ivan Toney. This just lets Brentford get their bearings again and reset for the last 15 minutes. Even with 10 men, they still look solid at the back.

**79’:** Traoré’s pace is something else, but the production isn’t there again. He charges through down the right once again, and gets his head up to spot unmarked Wolves shirts in the box. He clips it in but it’s too high for both Trincão and Podence who both had tap ins.

**80’:** Games breaking down into chaos now. Jansson is down again and Thomas Frank is fuming at the referee. Frank is booked for his outburst.

**82’:** Brentford now make a change, and it’s Jansson going off, he’s replaced by Mathias Jørgensen. Wolves also take the time to make a change, Nelson Semedo is replaced by Fábio Silva, roughly the 8th forward on the pitch at this point!

**84’:** Strange foul but a chance for Wolves. Podence gets it on the edge of the box and turns Janelt inside and out. Janelt falls and kicks out at Podence, tripping him and giving Wolves half a hope here… or not, Trincão fires over.

**86’:** Creative from Toney. He gets a bit of a gap between the Wolves defence and spots Sá off his line from about 30 yards out. Toney flicks a foot at it but sends it over.

**87’:** Traoré finally produces and it’s almost the moment for Jiménez! Traoré gets past Roerslev down the right and just keeps the ball in, sending in a cross that Jiménez rises well for but heads just wide of the post.

**89’:** Feels like I’m typing the same thing over and over again, as Traoré gets down the right again, but fires across a ball way over the top of anyone and out for a throw.

**90’:** Now Brentford hit the bar! Mbuemo finds space between the Wolves back line and charges through it. He gets to the area, fires with his left but is denied by the woodwork. 6 minutes added time announced as Podence chips the ball over the Brentford goal.

**90+1:** Chance for Janelt to make it 3. Onyeka does well on the right and tries to fire a ball across. It’s deflected and comes to the edge for Janelt, but he drags his shot wide. Note to make, at some point between the Jiménez header wide and now, he’s thrown his protective headband off, I hope that he is ok to do that?

**90+4’:** Not a bad effort from Rúben Neves. There’s no way through for Wolves as Brentford keep their tight set-up, leading to a long shot from Neves, which flies just over the crossbar.

**90+6’:** The sustained pressure from Wolves comes to nothing, Brentford calmly work their way out. Ivan Toney manages to turn Conor Coady and is hauled down by the Wolves captain, who gets a yellow card.

**FULL TIME’: WOLVES 0-2 BRENTFORD** Full time and there are boos around Molineux. Wolves were poor defensively and just had no final product, whilst Brentford performed exactly how they needed to and hardly put a foot wrong bar the red card for Baptiste. A lot of work for Wolves to get themselves up the table, but Brentford have settled right in to the top flight, moving up to 9th place.

**MAN OF THE MATCH**

It’s obvious that it’s going to be a Brentford player, but you could make a case for most of the Brentford team. I’m going with the easy pick but he was the most influential player in the match, and that’s Ivan Toney. He was a handful throughout to the Wolves back line, and got himself a well deserved goal and an assist.WOLVES 0-2 BRENTFORD (18/09/2021)",,0

2021-09-18,"I’ve been watching the prem for 13 years, but the number of red and yellow cards distributed in the first few weeks has been rather high this season. I’m not sure if it is a result of VAR, or if the “not calling the little stuff” allows the games to get chippier and more out of hand…. Or if I am just misremembering the start of other seasons. Does anyone else feel as though the cards being shown is high? 

Maybe the games with the high number of cards are just the ones I catch being broadcast?

2021-09-17,"After reading about it i want to discuss whether the BPS system in Fantasy Premier League could be adequately modified and used as a form of player analysis. I have absolutely zero statistical knowledge but i think that by adding more criteria and adjusting points for different positions instead of just forward, midfielder, defender and goalkeeper could be used to analyse a players performance. It could even be grouped, in specific situations like defensive actions, where possibly instead of counting all as one; interceptions, blocks, tackles, etc. would have different scores.

2021-09-17,"You always hear pundits talk about Newcastle like they're a big club with passionate fans but, honestly, the toxicity from their fanbase is a dead weight. I know a lot of people think that the ownership is poor, but regardless of what anyone thinks of Ashley, the way the fans treat the managers and players is a disgrace at times. If you were a decent player, why would you choose Newcastle over a similar sized club? Purely on the fans alone, why would you risk that negativity and toxicity coming from the stands each week?

Lots of clubs have bad owners. I'm a Bolton fan, I know all about that, but if their fans think that the worst scenario is to be a solid Premier League team at a club that makes a profit, they don't know how lucky they are. Ask Bury or Bolton fans what truly bad ownership is like, ask Charlton or Portsmouth fans and yet at no point where these clubs are depressingly negative as Newcastle fans.

Steve Bruce is hardly a great manager but, again, the negativity before he was in charge for a single game was ridiculous. You just look at the scenario and think...why would anyone want to manage or play there, when it's such a toxic environment? If the fans had been as supportive as they should be, they'd have performed far better in recent years but no matter what things are like on the pitch, such a cancerous fanbase guarantees that they'll be swimming against the tide.Newcastle fans are a hindrance to their club",,0

So its fair to say that there is no set definition for world class. 

When I did a quick Google search for the meaning of world class, I got that it is: (of a person, thing, or activity) of or among the best in the world.

I agree with that completely, so much so that I have a really high standard for world class. In my opinion, a world class player is a player that is top 3 in their position (lets say top 6 for CMs and CBs, since there are usually at least 2 of them on the field, especially CBs).

Before I really get into this, this is my first time ever writing up a match report. I’ve always had a passion for football, it’s a large part of my life, so I wanted to try something different and see how it goes. When you’re thinking about first games to ‘cover’, Everton vs Burnley on a Monday night isn’t really the first fixture that springs to mind, but it’s a bit of an in the moment decision to try it.

The plan is to put the line-ups first along with substitutes, then match stats, then go through a breakdown of the game through the minutes that notable incidents in the game happened, and then end off with my overall summary of the game and naming a MOTM.

**Review by Minutes**

**2’:** A very Burnley start to the game as Josh Brownhill takes down Richarlison with a rash slide tackle from behind, fortunately Richarlison was ok.

**6’:** First chance of the game and it was more than the half chance it became really. A delightful ball in from Dwight McNeil isn’t met by the head of Chris Wood, who may have been slightly off put by the Everton defenders in front of him.

**10’:** A summary so far, Burnley pressing high and fast, and Everton sloppy in possession, they are trying to match Burnley’s speed off the ball with their own on it, and it’s just leading to loose passes.

**17’:** More summary, it’s sloppy from both teams, Everton still playing too fast for themselves, whilst Burnley mainly just lump either over or around the Everton defence for Wood and Barnes to chase.

**19’:** Burnley getting the ball into the box a couple of times in the last couple minutes, with half chances for Chris Wood, one looping header into Pickford’s gloves and one that was flicked behind for a corner. From that corner, Ben Mee gets a half chance as he heads wide just in front of Pickford. On further viewing of the corner though, Everton are lucky not to give away a penalty as Doucouré was the wrong side of Tarkowski and pulled him down.

**22’:** A brief note, Richarlison is looking a very lonely figure up front, he’s trying to press but no-one is following him.

**26’:** Another note, the couple of times Everton have got forward, it’s been down the left, and Coleman has had acres of space down the right-hand side for a switch of play, he’s been ignored both times, one of those by Demarai Gray, who opted for a speculative effort from 30 yards, it trickled wide of Pope’s goal. Burnley are defending very tight and it’s leaving space down the opposite wing.

**27’:** Brownhill had a really good chance, either side of Pickford and it’s in after Barnes fought well to lay it off to him just inside the box.

**28’:** The game starting to heat up, Doucouré breaks into the Burnley area for the first time and lashes a shot across goal, a strong hand from Nick Pope keeps it out.

**32’:** Everton slowly waking up, Yerry Mina has a half chance with a header after the ball was recycled back into the area from Michael Keane after a free-kick was only half cleared.

**33’:** Almost the start of a fight, Richarlison charges down Ben Mee who clears the ball, but Richarlison falls onto Mee, who is down briefly. Ref stops play so Mee can get treatment, and Tarkowski steps in to wind up Richarlison. Coleman involved as well but all is resolved quickly. Ben Mee is fine to continue.

**37’:** The long ball up towards Wood and Barnes isn’t working too well, but Keane and Mina don’t look comfortable with it either, so it may be Burnley’s best option behind crosses.

**39’:** It’s getting better from Everton, Richarlison plays a lovely reverse pass down the line for Coleman, who pulls it back for Demarai Gray who fires wide. It wouldn’t have mattered anyway, the flag goes up, Coleman was offside.

**48-49’:** Within the first 4 minutes of the second half, 2 Burnley players should probably be in the book, but not even a foul was given on either. Richarlison making his way down the line was abruptly crunched by Tarkowski who got the ball, but the follow-through was a dangerous one. Mere moments later and Charlie Taylor goes through the back of Townsend, but no foul given. To rub salt into the wounds, Townsend then trips a surging Taylor moments later and receives a very harsh yellow card.

**53’: GOAL BURNLEY!** Burnley have a free kick on the left, swung in and initially headed away by Everton, but Gudmundsson pick it up on the right side of the area and swings in a peach of a ball, that is attacked well by Ben Mee who heads in past Pickford. A very rough 5 minutes for Everton who now find themselves behind.

**55’:** Everton quickly back on the attack as Coleman finds himself in an advanced position down the right. His low cross is blocked behind by goal scorer Ben Mee, rather painfully as it turns out, it hit him in a very tender area!

**60’: GOAL EVERTON!** The centre backs are the ones getting the headlines so far in this one! A corner is half cleared by Burnley, but the ball is worked around and eventually comes to Townsend on the right. He cuts back and swings in a left footed cross, which is met by a rising Michael Keane at the front post, who was surprisingly unmarked. Nothing Pope can do about it and Everton are level. Everton still go ahead with a pre-planned change, and it’s a change of tactic from Benitez, Godfrey is replaced by André Gomes.

**65’: GOAL EVERTON!** Oh my word pick that one out! Josh Brownhill plays a loose pass in midfield, Doucouré gets it to Townsend, who carries the ball through the middle until around 25-30 yards out, where he unleashes a beautiful curling effort that nestles in the top corner past the outstretched Nick Pope. Wonderful strike and Everton in front now!

**66’: GOAL EVERTON!** This is just getting out of hand now, 27 in play seconds after Townsend’s rocket, Everton make it 3-1. Burnley kick off and look to get up the pitch. However they lose possession, Townsend flicks the ball of to Doucouré who find the run of Demarai Gray who is clean through of goal with Matt Lowton well out of positon. The former Leicester City man keeps his composure and slots past Nick Pope for his 3rd goal of the season already, what a manic 7 minutes this has been!

**68’:** Everton thought they had a 4th in 8 minutes! A lovely team move from Everton results in Coleman playing a low pass into the areas which Doucouré sweeps home, but the flag is correctly raised, Doucouré was just slightly offside. That spares more Burnley blushes.

**70’:** The change that Rafa made has paid off hugely, the extra body in midfield has just swarmed the previously swarming Burnley. The hunter has become the hunted.

**73’:** It should be 4-1! Townsend gets the ball on the right and cuts inside, unleashing another thunderbolt of a strike, but Nick Pope makes a very good save. That’s not the big chance though, as Everton retain possession, and Doucouré, who has taken control of the game in this last 15 minutes, slots through substitute André Gomes, but he can’t wrap his foot around it enough and it rolls wide. More relief for Burnley who have just collapsed.

**74’:** Almost a spark for Burnley. Josh Brownhill makes a surging run forward and is found. He tries to play a ball across the area, but it’s blocked by the tracking Allan. The block almost went badly though, as it looped up and over Pickford, but wide. The resulting corner sees Burnley score as Tarkowski heads in from a secondary ball back in, but it’s disallowed as Pickford was blocked from claiming the ball by and offside Chris Wood. Burnley also take the time to make some changes, Jóhann Berg Gudmundsson and Ashley Barnes are replaced by Aaron Lennon and Matĕj Vydra.

**80’:** Everton make their second change of the match, Richarlison, who isn’t too impressed with this, is subbed off for Salomón Rondón, who is making his Everton debut.

**83’:** Burnley still trying but it’s very tame efforts. This time it’s Dwight McNeil from the edge of the box, hitting one low through a crowd of players, but it’s straight at Jordan Pickford.

**86’:** Burnley’s last change, they bring on Jay Rodriguez for Chris Wood.

**87’:** And now Everton’s final change, the scorer of the 3rd goal, Demarai Gray, is replaced by Alex Iwobi.

**89’:** Just a half chance but something for Jay Rodriguez. A cross into the box comes to him, but he can only head over the bar.

**90+2’:** Nearly another well worked goal by Everton, and maybe should have been a better chance than it ended up being. A nice passing move results in Townsend on the right side of the box, putting in a cross that ends up evading everyone. Iwobi collects at the left side of the area and tries a pullback, but Burnley comfortably clear.

**90+3’:** Another Burnley shot on target, another one straight at Pickford, it’s Dwight McNeil again this time.

**FULL TIME: EVERTON 3-1 BURNLEY**

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

The first half felt very much like a Burnley type of game. They came out and played hard, pressed high, and wanted to get the ball back at all times. Everton didn’t cope well with that for the first 30-35 minutes. They did manage to start producing towards the end of the half, but all momentum was gone by the start of the second half. Burnley again came out hard, the Tarkowski and Taylor challenges proof of that, and whilst they maybe didn’t deserve to take the lead, you couldn’t knock them on going in front. A lapse in concentration led to the equaliser, and then Benitez committed to a change he was going to make before the Keane goal. He swapped out the 5 at the back to a more traditional 4, got another body in the middle in Gomes, and the game swung straight away. Burnley collapsed in a way that you don’t often see, but it does feel like Burnley don’t know what to do when they have a lead. The once terrifying pressure they were putting the Everton players under disappeared and 2 goals in 27 seconds will knock the life out of any team. Burnley look devoid of any confidence and it’s tough to see where any improvement comes from, though I do hope they do well this season. As for Everton, it was a very good fight back from a potentially tough situation. Benitez made a good call as mentioned, and the players produced when needed. They are very good value for their 4th place right now.

**MOTM**

Two names came to mind at the end of the game, one being Abdoulaye Doucouré, who controlled the game when he was allowed to advance more in the second half, but I’m going to go with Andros Townsend. His goal was an absolute screamer, his assist for the first goal was a solid ball in, and his flick set off the 3rd goal, just moments after his goal.

And so that’s it, my first match review. If you have read this far thank you very much, please do let me know what you thought of the game, and please let me know what you think of this write-up. I’ll be looking to do more of these in the future, so any improvements that I can make would be greatly appreciated!EVERTON 3-1 BURNLEY (13/09/2021)",,0

2021-09-13,"Penalties are always something that if a player scores one, people will often ignore it. This is something that has been used against Fernandes his entire Premier League career as well as Vardy last season. Both players scored a great amount of goals in those time periods from the spot and this has been used against them.

Now, penalties are usually scored about 75,57% of the time among male footballers. . Despite this, I was usually of the opinion that we should consider it like any other goal because you have to win a penalty in the first place. That's why I still considered Bruno and Vardy to be such good players last season, despite their great amount of penalty goals. 

But I am a bit unsure now. I feel now that it would be better to ignore how many penalty goals a player scored but also consider the amount of penalties that they won as an important stat, because to get the ball to an easy position like that requires them to win it. But even with that, I'm unsure because of this Benzema and Ronaldo situation that I will go on about now.

In 2021, it seems like its still a generally accepted opinion that Ronaldo is clearly better than Benzema. But the stats are confusing me a bit. If I am correct, since Ronaldo left Real Madrid, Benzema has scored 92 goals for club and scored 4 goals at the Euros (the only time that Benz has played for France since Ronaldo left Real Madrid), which is 96 goals in 155 games. Thats 0,62 goals per game.

Ronaldo has scored 5 goals at the Euros and 103 goals for club during that same period of time. Thats 108 goals in 139 games, which is 0,78 goals per game. That seems like Ronaldo is exceptionally better at goal scoring than Benzema. 

But then we remove the penalties. Without penalties, Benzema has 95 goals in 155 games. That is 0,61 goals per game. Ronaldo has 76 goals in 139 games, which 0,55 goals per game. Suddenly Benzema is looking better. 

Even if we add their penalties won to this total, Ronaldo still has a total of 79 (76 non pen goals+3 penalties won) in 139 games and Benzema has a total of 96 (95 non pen goals+1 penalty won) in 155 games. Benzema has a ratio of 0,62 per game while CR7 has a ratio of 0,57.

Considering that Benzema also does more outside the box, does this mean that Benzema is definitely better than Ronaldo? I think that you would struggle to find people with this opinion but this is the result that you get when you do not use penalties to rate players.

This was my 2 cents on this. If I made any math calculation errors, let me know because I did do all this quite quickly considering how much there is. What do you think of penalties when it comes to judging attackers? And what do you think about the Benzema vs Ronaldo thing?Should penalties be included when discussing about and comparing attackers?",self,0

All you heard about yesterday on social media was how the Leeds fans booed Harvey Elliott off the pitch, and saw plenty of comments even on here along the lines of ‘what else would you expect from Leeds fans, typical scum’ and whilst I love it when people hate us, I’d rather it be for things we actually did.

I was at the game and can 100% assure you barely anyone booed, I didn’t hear it but I’m sure someone out of the 37,000 people there would have done. The ground was filled with applause as he was stretchered off but none of you seem to be acknowledging that. Instead, you discuss how horrible we are because a couple hundred people might have booed, just like what happens at every single ground in the country. EVERY FANBASE HAS DICKHEADS!

What you didn’t hear about though, was all the Liverpool fans singing chants about Istanbul and getting Turkish flags up on their phones (which was likely pre-meditated as phone signal is hard to come by at Elland Road) I bet most of you reading this didn’t even know it happened.

It happened at Old Trafford as well. You all knew about the Rashford/ Sancho chant and the pricks singing about Munich, but you had no idea about the Istanbul chants and the Man United fans that turned up with ACTUAL TURKEY FLAGS to throw on the away end.

I feel like I was still digesting the Champions League Final (awesome), Euros (awesome), and crazy offseason roster moves, and now suddenly the PL is in full swing.

By comparison the NFL only plays 5-6 months of the year, then we have a long offseason to overanalyze everything and by the time August-September rolls around we're desperate to watch football (our version) and the opening games are this grand celebration after a hibernation period.

For a casual football (your version) fan like myself it just feels like theres always games happening and it diminishes the sense of urgency to tune into the PL.

I'll still eventually tune in cause I love football but I feel like a little more breathing room would have given me some time to get excited for PL this year.

2021-09-12,"Some fans at every club are wankers and I wish they’d fuck off.

I’m coming at this from the perspective of a Leeds fan of over 25 years. We’ve always been singled out for fan behaviour and it’s not always been fair. We suffered from bad publicity from being a big side out of the establishment in the 60s and 70s, just before hooliganism really kicked off.

Honestly today though, it’s like some twats seem to actively WANT people to hate us. It’s a meme that we get flak for everything, but do you actually have to give people ammo?

Most of our fans applauded and understood the gravity of the situation… but some of them…

When a player is down who is obviously hurt and your own player is clearly in shock how is it your first thought to sing about people dying at Hillsborough? Then to welcome your new signing you then sing about Munich - not only making your new player feel unwelcome but also make us even more of a hate figure.

Pascal Struijk looked like he was about to fall apart after seeing the consequences of that challenge. He’ll have a hard time accepting what it will have done to Harvey Elliot (who I hope makes a full recovery and has a stellar career). But the actions of fans will make it a lot easier to turn Struijk into a hate figure.

I’m fed up of these sorts of people and the majority of fans are too. Most of us make a point by standing and applauding to try and drown out the minority of people making these chants and booing our own players taking a knee. 

And it’s not just us either, it’s every time you turn on the TV. Some twat supporting Chelsea couldn’t help but contain his scream at a Villa player from the stands while sticking up two fingers for having the audacity to take a corner. A Man United fan decided to put a Turkish flag up above the Leeds away end to poke fun at the fact we had two fans stabbed against Galatasaray in 2000.

And I have to ask: what are you cunts getting out of this?! Why is it that you can only enjoy football through making others feel worse? Can’t you support without committing a borderline hate crime?

I was a season ticket holder for a lot of the 90s and 2000s and I’d gone into this season waiting to get that same feeling back I had when top sides would come to an electric Elland Road (back when we’d often win and not get played off the park like today). 

But instead, just like when I saw the behaviour of so many of the same people at the Euros, I just bury my head in my hands. Then I remember that I enjoy football in spite of a huge number of fans.Hot Take: The best thing about lockdown is you could forget how many football fans are bell ends.",,0

2021-09-12,"&amp;#x200B;

 had a bad debut but his duels vs Zaha wasn't as one sided as many make it out to be. The tide soon changed after the red card though",,0
2021-09-12,"I used to watch the game in high school (like a dumbass I started cause my crush liked it) but I throughly enjoyed it, however I've been out of touch w the game for a couple years now and I'm back to square one, it's like I've forgotten everything about it (I don't even know which club I love cause I used to root for chelsea back in the day just cause my crush loved them) and now idk where to start but I really want to get back into it cause man did i enjoy it back then.

2021-09-12,"*Here's a piece I wrote on medium ranking PL teams 1-20 in tiers! If you enjoy it, let me know, I'm doing a Champions League tiers piece too. I have medium account where I post most of my writing.* 

 Premier League clubs spent more than £1 billion despite the financial impacts of the Coronavirus. With the transfer window now closed, I’ve decided to take stock of the league and group all 20 Premier League teams into tiers heading into match day 4 and beyond.

From the contenders to the pretenders, to the teams who look to be in for a long season fighting the relegation battle.

I prefer tiers as to say power rankings as it forces you to draw boundaries and consider the league holistically. Even if you accept that differences between tiers is fluid and subjective. You won’t disagree with all my choices, but football is a game of opinions. (If we can disagree and be civil about it – then we’ve found the winning formula.)

## Tier 1 – Real Title Challengers

**Manchester City**

**Chelsea**

**Manchester United**

**Liverpool**

Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United are a currency onto themselves. With gargantuan never-ending wage bills and financial clout that in a pandemic can spend a combined 331.2 million pounds.

* Defending champions City got off to a typically slow start, being beaten on the counter-attack by Tottenham and Heung Min-Son. Since then it’s been business as usual. Harry Kane or not this is a stacked City side, the 100 million pound addition of Jack Grealish gives Pep that x-factor hybrid creator/dribbler to break down compact defences. De Bruyne is arguably the best midfielder in the world, Sterling is coming off a strong Euros, Ferran Torress looks to be adapting to the centre-forward role, Phil Foden is one of the best English prospects of his generation. The Jesus, Mahrez, Gundagon, Berando crop fill out a dynamic attack. While Cancleo, Walker, Dias, Stones, Ederson is as good a back five as the league has to offer.

The real star of the show though is still Pep Guardiola and his passing, possession, pressing system. Yes, he spends a lot of money and no he probably couldn’t win the title with Burnley. But Pep coaches players on the training ground, improve them, individually and tactically.

* Thomas Tuchel has already had a transformative impact on Chelsea steering the blues to their second European Cup. Implementing a 3–4–2–1 formation that defensively rock solid and offensively capable of beating teams through the middle or by stretching the play out-wide – as noted by Pep Guardiola “T*hey have three central defenders and two holding midfielders and the distances are so, so close, then, at the same time, they are so wide with the wing-backs and have so much depth with Timo Werner moving in behind. That’s why you can’t be close because they push you here (wide), they push you here* (from back to *front), and they have good players in the middle. That’s why it’s difficult.”*

Add in 97.5 million pound man Romelu Lukaku to the mix, a guaranteed 20 plus goals per season. Lukaku is now one of the best handful of centre forward on the planet; combining – pace, power, physicality with great link-up play, dribbling and finishing. Saul Niguez deadline day arrival brings more quality to a team two-deep with top-class players at almost every position.

* Man United with the homecoming of 5-time Ballon d’Or winner and GOAT candidate – CR7, plus the addition of World Cup winner. Raphael Varane have no more excuses and must mount a title challenge.

The squad is now as good as any in the league, with the only two questions marks being; is Fred or Scott McTominay good enough to be the engine of the title-winning side? and secondly, can David De Gea find his old form and if not is Dean Henderson good enough?

In attack, United are stacked with dribblers, playmakers and goal scores. Picking a forward line to play around Cristiano presents a fascinating question for Solskjaer. He can play 4–3–3 with Fernandes and Pogba as ‘attacking eights’, with two of Cavani, Greenwood, Rashford, Sancho, Martial, Lingard alongside Ronaldo. More likely though is a 4–2–3–1 with Pogba alongside McTomiany in midfield, Bruno in the number ten position and Sancho and Rashford as wide forwards, with Greenwood in the super-sub role.

The biggest question remains on manager Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer, he’s undoubtedly improved the mood and results at Old Trafford, but expectations are high, and rightfully so. United have not won the league since 2013 and the champions league since 2008. Until Solskjaer proves his stripes tactically, it’s impossible to put him in the same breath as Guardiola, Klopp and Tuchel, who all have clearly defined tactical identifies in and out of possession. For Olle we know his teams can counter-attack, but can he coordinate a team into structured attacking sequences and set them up to be in the right places at the right time on and off the ball?

Only time will tell, another underperforming season and the media will be calling for Olle’s head.

* Liverpool’s smart transfer recruitment is well documented by now, while they don’t spend money as lavishly as their other title co-mates, they do have a team that is only two years removed from a dominating title win in 2019–20. The starting XI is as good as any in world football, the front three led by Mohamed Salah, as good as any in Europe. Liverpool also have Virgil Van Dijk back, fit and raring to go, when Van Dijk plays Liverpool have a 70.68 win percentage (W: 94, D: 17, L: 22), his leadership, composure and physical attributes truly make him a singular talent.

The top four looks more than in any season in recent memory a true top four, you could reasonably argue that there are four of the top six teams in world football (on paper at least with PSG and Bayern Munich the other two.)

The title race has all the hallmarks of being a vintage campaign, with four superpowers well within the right to believe they have what it takes to be champions of England.

## Tier 2 – Top 4 would be top draw

**Tottenham**

**Leicester City**

* Tottenham or not the Harry Kane team as Pep Guardiola once posited, only to try and sign Kane this summer and make them the ‘Son Heung Min’ team, top the table after three matchdays and Nuno Espirito Santo style of football does not look too dissimilar to that of Jose Mourinho (who remember had an excellent relationship with his superstar forward – Harry Kane). The mood does appear brighter in Tottenham HQ though, Jose has a way of making his environments feel toxic at times, even if I feel like the British media, loves to tear down Jose, the second he gives an inch, his critics are happy to take a mile. That’s neither here nor there though, this Spurs side with Kane, Son and a team full of Champions and Europa League quality players, should be battling for that 5th spot. It’s a big season for manager Nuno too, can he prove his worth as a manager good enough to coach one of the ‘European super-clubs.’

If you’ve been living under a rock ill remind you of this stat; throughout two seasons 2019–20 and 2021–21, Leicester spent more time In the four than any other Premier League team, being in the top four for 68 of the 72 match weeks only to slip out of the qualification spots in the last week.

* If Leicester achieves that elusive 4th place spot this season it will be well earned, with the league looking as competitive as it has in years. With a strong spine, another strong season should be expected. The ageless Jamie Vardy leads the line, a possessed man, with the art of winding up opposition fans, with stadiums full again, watch out. Youri Tielemans and Wilfred Ndidii anchor a strong, technical midfield. As one of the best midfield duos in the league. Kasper Schmeichel leads as well as stops shots in between the posts.

Leicester with their title win in 2016 and FA Cup last season, have taken Arsenal place in the traditional ‘big six’. Brendan Rodgers has established himself as a top-class manager, who can improve players, get the best out of his teams tactically and he talks a good game too.

## Tier 3 – The Everton Cup

**Everton**

**West Ham**

**Arsenal**

The line between tier 2 and 3 is very thin and you could talk me into any of Arsenal, Everton or West Ham being in tier 2 and I wouldn’t push back. Tottenham and Leicester’s reputation and experience over the last few seasons keeps them a notch ahead for now.

* The battle for 7th place and the annual Everton cup naturally includes the Toffees of Merseyside. With Liverpool’s iconic champions league winning manager, sitting at the front of your club’s identity, it still feels like a strange marriage between Benitez and Everton fans. It’s like your best friend getting with the girl you loved for 15 years.

That being said Benitez is still a B-plus manager in European football, he will organise Everton defensively and should make them coherent enough offensively to be competitive in most games. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is a legitimately good centre forward who’s improving every season. Richarlsion is a game-changing talent, who can dribble, create and score goals. There’s a reason he’s been linked with PSG, Real Madrid and Barcelona. Demari Gray is bargain signing of the summer at £1.5 million. The Salomon Rondon, Rafa Benitez obsession continues with Benitez’s having signed Rondon for Newcastle, Dalian Professional and now Everton.

* West Ham has picked up where they left off from last season, with David Moyes second act continuing to prove his sceptics wrong. A midfield backbone of Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek are a versatile midfield duo. Both are so disciplined in their roles and have an almost telepathic understanding in the heart of West Ham’s midfield.

Michel Antonio gets an F for his film trivia, celebrating becoming the Hammers all-time top scorer by doing a dance from ‘*Dirty Dancing*’ and thinking it was from ‘*Save the Last Dance’*\- Antonio kissing the life-sized cardboard cut out of himself, and then proceeding to give a wonderful personable interview on Sky Sports after, was the highlight of the early season. A footballer with personality, the game needs more of the likes of Antonio, sign me up right now for the; Micah Richards meets Michel Antonio interview.

Antonio transformation as a player is a sight to behold from right back to centre forward. 4 goals and 3 assists to start the season, the 31-year-old is having a late-career peak and looks like the complete package in the number nine shirt. Putting in all-around dominant 90-minute performances, like he did verse Leicester City and you’d be mistaken for not thinking Antonio was Lukaku 2.0.

* Ah, Arsenal, the sky is falling, the bottom of the table, scored 0, conceded 9. Arteta, on the touchline, looking a forlorn figure, like a lost soul, tactics not tuning into performances, players positionally lost and in need of a magic genie to save the sinking ship.

It hardly helps matters that; Mezut Ozil chilling in Fenerbahce on his 3 million euros per season, tweeting “*trust the process*.” – Arsenal needs to find a way of the ball hitting the back net and quickly. A massive run of fixtures await the Gunners after the International break as they take on; Norwich, Burnley, Tottenham, Brighton and Crystal Palace. Performance and points are essential to Arsenal and Arteta’s future.

The bottom line is that Arsenal in my opinion is still way too talented to finish any worse than 9th.

## Tier 4 – Top 10 contenders

**Aston Villa**

**Brighton**

**Leeds**

* Villa fans probably believe they belong in the tier above and they have a point; Danny Ings is one of the best goal scorers in the league, period. Emiliano Buendia at £33 million has the talent to be an absolute superstar, already a technical master and top tier playmaker, if he can get anywhere close to his championship production last season of 15 goals and 16 assists, his price tag will soon triple. Villa look solid head to toe on paper and manager Dean Smith faces the challenge of getting his boys to compete for the Europa League spots.
* Brighton has become everybody’s second favourite team under Graham Potter playing attractive, attacking, possession-based football. Finding a source of regular goals will be the difference between Brighton repeating last season struggles or pushing on and playing for the top ten. Last season the Seagulls were like a heavyweight boxer, who did everything well in the ring but had no-knock out punch. The substance of a great team with no end product. Neil Maupy is only 25 years old and has looked sharp in the first few weeks of the season. Yves Bissouma is a game-changer and a difference-maker, except the transfer rumours to intensify about the Ivory Coast international as January and the summer comes around.
* Bielsa Leeds lit up the premier league last season with their ultra-aggressive pressing, vertical attacking in numbers and man to man-marking. One of the genuine bright sparks in a season played behind closed doors. This season Leeds fans will be hoping for more of the same. Kalvin Phillips and Patrick Bamford are quality players. Raphinha offers skill and creativity, his name not showing up in the transfer rumour mill, was good news for the Leeds faithful. The 25 million pound man Dan James brings direct pace and a real counter-attacking threat.

## Tier 5 – Too good to go down too bad to do anything

**Southampton**

**Wolves**

* In Ralph Hasenhutl Southampton have a German coach, who sets his team up to play with high energy, a high press and is not afraid to go toe to toe with the big boys. Southampton problems lie in finding goals, consistency and not getting beat 9–0.

Southampton owners don’t look to be overly interested in building a side that can find that consistency and compete for the Europa League, the Saints had become a staple in the top ten but now look content to just survive in the Premier League. Selling Danny Ings (Aston Villa) and Jannik Vestergaard (Leicester City) and letting Ryan Bertrand leave on a free transfer (Leicester City). Adam Armstrong scored 28 goals for Blackburn and arrives for 15 million pounds, he has big shoes to fill.

* Bruno Lage and his pack of Wolves are a competent side on paper. With technical savants like Ruben Neves and cheat code dribblers like Adama Traore adding a real dynamism to their play. Raul Jimenez is back and it’s great to see, if he can re-find his pre-injury form then Wolves are in the wrong tier and should finish higher up the table.

Raul Neto absence is a huge blow. The 21-year old Portuguese winger was developing into a superstar last season.

## Tier 6 – Relegation Battle

**Brentford**

**Crystal Palace**

**Newcastle**

**Burnley**

**Watford**

**Norwich**

* Brentford despite finishing 3rd in the championship, look like the most likely promoted side to stay in the league. Thomas Franks men play a style of football not too dissimilar to Bielsa Leeds with an emphasis on tempo, aggression and pressing. In Ivan Toney, The Bees have a centre forward at the peak of his powers, if he can manage half of the 31 goals he scored in the Championship, Brentford have a great shot at survival. Scoring goals is the hardest thing to do at the Premier League level, it’s been proven time and time again in the Premier League era, that at the top level, you need a goalscorer.
* Sean Dyche, Burnley and his wrestling/jujitsu squad of players will keep doing what Burnley do best. Play a disciplined 4–4–2 formation, with emphasise on being fitter and stronger than their opponents. Dyche has nearly been in charge a decade now and he’s done a phenomenal job, getting the best out of his players, – will this be the season his old-school approach finally hits a brick wall?
* Crystal Palace transition from the Roy Hodgson era is in full swing, departing alongside their owl look-alike manager, we’re several veterans Gary Cahill, Wayne Hennessey, Mamadou Sakho, James McCarthy and Andros Townsend.

Patrick Viera brings hope, the hope of a new era, the hope of a more modern brand of football. But to quote Geroge Costanza “*it’s the hope that’s kills you*.” Palace has a raucous home atmosphere that with the fans back should see them, pick up some points. Wilfred Zaha now resigned to retiring in a Palace shirt, is still one of the better wide players in the league. Eberechi Eze and Connor Callagher are young English prospects with huge potential.

* Newcastle continues their perpetual, never-ending cycle that is the Mike Ashley era. Steve Bruce has never been enamoured by the fan base and playing pragmatic, sit on the edge of your box and kick it long, hope for the best football will not help his case. While the criticism at times has been harsh, there’s a pretty definitive ceiling on Steve Bruce side.

Wilson, Saint-Maxim and Willock should on paper at least be enough goals and creativity to stay in the league, but as long as Ashley lurks in the background and Bruce produces more first half’s like the one against Southampton, the toxicity will not go away.

* Norwich are back in the big time again and once again have started slowly, with three defeats in a row.

Billy Gilmour and Brandon Williams are an astute bit of business on loan from Chelsea and Manchester United respectively and will have plenty of opportunities to prove their quality.

Daniel Farke is a manager who has a system, a philosophy, a style of play, that with an even playing field can win a lot of games (IE: the championship), keeping the Canaries in the Premier League though, he will have to turn doubters into believers.

* Watford haven’t sacked manager Xisco yet and he only got 3 points out of a possible 9, maybe the Pozzo owners are finally adopting a patient approach.

The Hornets have impressed in the first month of the season, showing they can be competitive at the Premier League level. In Ismaila Sarr and Emmanuel Dennis Watford have a couple of studs hugging the touchlines. The lack of end product and Premier League quality players in other positions, means, that the only goal this season is survival.Premier League Tiers 2021-22",,0

2021-09-08,"Hey Premier League fans. I am a prem fan from Romania that is also a Brentford fan since 2013. Today i will write down my prediction for this season. When i feel neccessary i left also some reasons about it. So let get started:

1. Chelsea

Very good squad; excellent manager they got all they need to win it

2. Man City

They are also very impressive but i just feel that Chelsea is gonna have a better season.

3. Man United
4. Liverpool 
5. Spurs
6. West Ham

Their starting of the season is really good. Said Fornals Antonio are in a very good form and i think that can lead them to another geeat season.

7. Aston Villa

They invested so much and i think even without Grealish they had the potential to be a Top 7 team. 

8. Leicester 

I really think that after 2 seasons where they were so close to reach champions league this season is gonna be weaker for them. I am just not feeling the players motivated as much as they were before

9. Everton
10. Arsenal

The squad is pretty good but i really think that with Arteta as a coach they can not do more then that.

11. Leeds

Very entertaining team but it feels like they don t know how to defend. I think that this will cost them more than it did last season.

12. Wolverhampton 

They create chances but it feel like they don't have a striker to score from this chances. Is hard to think that Raul is gonna be ever again at the same level as he was before.

13. Brighton 
14. Newcastle 

The squad is not the best but they got enough experience to stay up.

15. Brentford 

And here it is my club. I am really positive about us because we really seem to play at a good level offensively and defensively. Also the weaker positions from the last Championship season were covered except for the RB. But the team play at a very good level and i think we have what it takes to survive.

16. Burnley
17. Southampton

Without Vestergaard and Ings is goona be a tough season for them. But i think they will avoid relegation but is not gonna be easy.

18. Crystal Palace

An inexperienced manager that i don t know how much he can halp the team. I know the did many transfers but i just feel that none of them can escape them from this situation. My opinion can change a lot ofc after i see Eze or Eduard playing.

2021-09-07,"**European Super League Survey Call!**

Hi Everyone,

I am currently doing research for my master's dissertation in Media and Pr.  For part of my research, I have a survey in circulation based on fans reactions to the European Super League crisis and how clubs can both improve their communications and relations with their publics. If anyone would be kind enough to help me with my research, the survey should only take about 10 minutes to complete. All responses are anonymous and confidential, so none of your details or data will be shared. The only two conditions are that you are both aged over 18 and support one of the six clubs that were involved in the Super League proposals (Arsenal, Chelsea, Man City, Man United, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur). This research will be playing a key role in my university dissertation and will be published by Newcastle University.

Here is the link to the survey:

-Klopp with the “Gegenpressing” counter-pressing focusing on winning the ball back nearer the goal to always be dangerous and ready.

2021-09-01,"Hello, as a kid that has grew up watching and playing football for my whole life, I actually haven't found my sweet spot yet. Since I live in Bulgaria, and especially a city in the country that doesn't have a local football team to support I found myself not enjoying the sport anymore because of the lack of loyalty and connection I have with a team. The worse thing is that my parents don't watch football and have never been too into it, since they basically have no free time after work. My grandma is the one that actively watched football, but not anymore. She was a Man Utd supporter, but I don't find joy in following a glory-hunting team, I would find 10x more joy from following a small team that rarely gets above mid-table, but be a loyal supporter to, learn all the history there is to learn, all the chants etc. I get a different kick from the Premier League and its basically the league that I watch all the time. So I want to find my sweet spot, I want to find MY team. I need a team that has longevity in the FPL, but isn't in the top 10, because I get more of a kick from teams like that rather than a team that always wins. Unfortunately in my country its close to impossible to watch Championship games, so EPL it is.Haven't found my sweet spot yet",,0
2021-09-01,A few weeks ago I saw an article talking about how Steve Bruce is a bad manager and a moron. I can't remember the article name in particular but it came from a website called the mag or something like that. The comments were mostly agreeing with the article. A few weeks later i saw another article on a different website saying something similar. Both websites seem as though they focus mainly on the club so i guess some fans of the club read them. Is what i said in the title true or is this just the opinion of a minority i saw?Do Newcastle fans dislike steve Bruce?,,0

2021-09-01,"In a recent post I looked at the Premier League table after 3 matches, comparing results vs those from the previous season, giving an alternative look at the PL table.

Someone suggested that I take a look at last season, looking at the results made and how they compared vs 2020/21. I always knew that Liverpool wouldn't score well, after winning almost every game in 19/20, were bound to drop off somewhat in 20/21. Sheffield United were the victims of their own success, and also were due a drop last season. We saw some improving teams - West Ham and Aston Villa in particular, showing signs of growth in this bizarre season. With no fans at the stadia, what impact would that make on results? As it seems to be the case, West Ham bossed it.

The visual below shows what the table would have looked like if we compared all games vs the same games played in 19/20, with points marking the relative improvement (or decline) in points in those fixtures. A score of 0 here means parity, that overall, that team got the same cumulative results in matches season-on-season. Negative means the team worsened, and positive means the team improved.

My, West Ham improved. They improved their score by 26 points against the same games season-on-season. That's over a 50% rise from their points total in 19/20. No other team really comes close, apart from Aston Villa, who very credibly scored 16 points more in equivalent games last season - nearly double that of champions Manchester City, in third.

West Ham *improved* on their result over 50% of their home games, and exactly 50% of their away games. The home stat is important, as last season was the first season in which more away wins were registered than home wins. 

In a season without crowds in the main, only 5 teams actually improved on their home results season-on-season. West Ham were way in front, with 12pts - second was Southampton (6), with only Villa, Brighton and Crystal Palace posting home improvements. One could question whether fans actually hinder West Ham, when playing at home.

It didn't seem so. They also registered a 14-point improvement season-on-season away from home. Only Everton can top this (16) - but where teams show a remarkable difference in their home vs away differential, West Ham were very consistent. And consistently, good.

Finally, West Ham also improved on their goal difference by THIRTY-FIVE season-on-season against these teams. Again, Aston Villa came close with 30. I'd have to look at previous seasons, but that will be up there as one of the biggest turnarounds.

The good news continues for Hammers fans so far this season - at this very early stage they are 3pts better off this season comparatively to matches last season, 2nd in the league. Very early days, but West Ham are trending very much in the right direction.

2021-09-01,"I got booted off r/Soccer for trying to open his discussion - admittedly the post was a bit triggering. I think (hope) we're up for a bit more rough and tumble here.

To surmise, Great =/= Best. For me Great is transcending ability and doing something truly meaningful. Both players have, but Messi always remained in his comfort zone. He became bigger than the club and caused absolute chaos in his Barca exit. That whole fake transfer thing last year, crocodile tears and leaving them financially crippled... Nice. Now he's at a cozy PSG to see out his days. He'll win a league title, score 30+, get his pat on the back.

Ronaldo, on the other hand, has gone challenge to challenge smashing every one. I think his move to Utd is arguably his biggest and greatest yet. He's past his best, yet still wants to mix it up in the Prem trying to repay his break-out club and restore them to glory. He absolutely might fail miserably. Speaks volumes about the man that he's willing to take that on at 36. More so than the 5 vs 6 ballon d'or argument or whatever other stat.

As I say, for me you can be great without being the best. Win or lose at United, Ronaldo is, in my mind, undoubtedly the GOAT.Does Ronaldo's move to United cement his place as the GOAT?",,0

We are constantly linked to Ruben Neves as a CDM and while I don’t think we will get him this season, I do see it as a potential signing in the future. 

Obviously we know his attacking capabilities as he’s a lot like a deep lying playmaker but my question is:

Is he good at defending?

2021-08-31,"For me its pretty simple.

* Disrespects Spurs fans for saying he wants to leave in an interview with Gary Neville
* Tells Levy he wants to leave, Levy is like ""Yeah sure man.....NOT""
* Kane goes to Florida after the euros until his dead with City is agreed and he misses that game
* Levy never accepts a fee and the season starts
* Kane is like ""Oh shit what do I do now, ahh I'll pretend I had an extra 2 weeks holidays than everyone else (for some reason)""
* Transfer window near ends and Levy isn't accepting a fee 
* Kane tweets ""I am staying because I love the fans!!(but its actually because I have no choice)

So yeah for me he was a selfish idiot and it blew up in his face, if he wanted to leave and let the fans understand AND put Levy in a tough position, he would have handed in a transfer request AND posted a post/video to the fans explaining his honest reason for doing so.

2021-08-31,"So apparently Peacock will show ""more than 175 matches LIVE plus full replays\* of all 380 matches."" Which means they will show all 380 premier league matches if I am not mistaken. BUT, the big catch is that the big games will be shown on NBCSN LIVE while Peacock subscribers have to wait 24 hrs to watch the games shown on NBCSN. Am I correct on all of this?

 Another thing, how long will these recordings be kept? And are they on-demand or only shown at a specific time? I am considering getting peacock instead of paying $35 a month for some streaming service that does not show all premier league games. My main point is that I want to be able to watch nearly every single Manchester United game, but since it is considered a big club, a lot of their games will be played on NBCSN. That means that I will have to keep away from YouTube and the such to not ""spoil"" the result. But there is also the question of how long the replays will be kept on and if they are on-demand. Year long? For a week? For 24 hours?Peacock VS Sling TV in the US",,0
2021-08-31,"I might be a little biased here but I'll try to be as objective as possible. I understand that it can be frustrating to watch for a lot of people as it limits the opposition's attack and the game slows down to a halt, but I've always enjoyed watching games where teams prioritize defence over scoring goals. If you're up by a goal or two and you can absolutely under no circumstances concede, then why isn't it a fair tactic? I kind of like to view it as a sort of war of attrition, where the resiliance of both teams is tested to its absolute limit. Is it as elegant to watch as skillful free-flowing set pieces and brilliant finishing goals? No, but I find it to be just as entertaining and definitely more intense. 

The reason I'm making this post (as some might have already figured by looking at my flair) is the outcome of the most recent Chelsea - Liverpool game. A lot of people are calling Chelsea ""cowards"" for adopting an intensely defensive formation after losing Reece James to a (for some reason controversial) red. I thought it was the best tactic they could deploy, considering Liverpool's immense attacking potential and their advantage in numbers. I mean, after a point you have to admit that the objective is to NOT LOSE instead of giving a good show.

I get that it can ""ruin"" the game for some but it's still a strategy that has its purpose.

Just to be clear I'm not just defending Chelsea here. A lot of teams be it on the international or club level deploy the ""park the bus"" tactic when they're priority is to prevent further conceding of goals, and IMO it can be quite fun to watch the opposition either successfully or unsuccessfully chipping away at the defense until they either give way or stand firm.

I might be wrong, and feel free to give your opinion, but do try to be civil.Why do people hate a ""park the bus"" strategy so much?",,0

2021-08-31,"I have a feeling City may struggle against Liverpool and Chelsea and may drop points in a few away games at teams they should be beating, whilst United have a Good Attack their recent performances show a lack of Spine in the Team which will be costly at some point. Chelsea look very solid defensively, they can score goals and with Lukaku they have one of the best strikers in the world, whilst Liverpool at Anfield are almost formidable and they tend to dispatch lower half teams, whilst they have one of the best front 3 and the likes of Harvey Elliott and Naby Keita who seem to be easing into the team. I think that Chelsea will fight Liverpool head to head for the Titlr similar to 2018/19 when Man City and Liverpool fought until the final day, and I think Chelsea will pip Liverpool by a point or too, City 7 points behind the Chelsea and 6 behind Liverpool, with United 3 points behind CityHow likely is a Liverpool and Chelsea 2 Team Title Race?",,0

2021-08-30,"Hi all,

I've recently gotten back into watching football, mostly the PL and some MLS. I grew up as a Man Utd. supporter as that's what my dad was. However I haven't really watched the PL for years, and I just don't feel the same connection to the club and players as I used to. Also, the back end of the club with the Glazers, overspending on players that don't really fit, etc. means they have really fallen out of my favor.

So, try and sell me on a new club to watch every week! Ideally it'd be a smaller club, maybe newly promoted. Who doesn't love an underdog story? I've caught a few games so far this season and have been watching all the match highlights on YouTube. So far I'm leaning towards either Brentford or Brighton.

2021-08-29,"I think the quality of the League has improved, the Top 4 are basically cut off at the minute in terms of quality (Tottenham, Leicester and West Ham just behind), with Leeds also having a Quality Side and playing great Football, whilst anyone in the League can beat anyone on their Day. On the other hand I feel that the Champions League as a Spectacle has slightly declined in terms of Entertainment factor, this may be due to the Decline of Barca, Real and Juventus, as there are only PSG, Bayern and the PL Clubs with a Realistic chance of winning it at the minute, although the PL Clubs are dominating  Europe again, I feel this is down to the quality of our League. I just generally feel CL games are less entertaining at the minute (The Liverpool v Barca and Ajax v Spurs semis were good a few years ago and PSG vs Bayern is a Tasty Clash, but even the Finals have been drab over the past few years).Anyone else think the Premier League Quality has Improved and the Champions League has gone down hill?",,0

2021-08-29,"For me Liverpool's Aging Squad and FSGs unwillingness to Spend means that I think they may end up dropping out of the Top 4 for a few years, as they may need time to rebuild the squad to be challenging the Manchester Clubs and Chelsea, although they have got good young players (Elliott, Trent, Konate, Jones etc). People may disagree but I feel that with the Right Management, I believe Everton have the potential to replace their City Rivals as the other top 4 side, the New Stadium under construction gives them a platform and something to look forward to, whilst players like Allan, Godfrey, Digne, Richarlison, Calvert Lewin and Doucoure can all provide a spine for the team, even Gray looks good when it didn't seem to work out at Leicester.Between Man City, Man United, Chelsea and Liverpool, which of these sides is most likely to drop out of the Top 4 over a few seasons, and who will Repapce that Team?",,0

2021-08-29,"Yes, yes I can. I do know that they need a CDM but I think with Ronaldo coming in their defensive problem will be solved using the Luis Enrique method; “if they score 1 we will score 3”.

No fan has the insights about players’ personalities and intangible strengths  to judge whether they’d be a good leader or not.

We don’t know how they communicate with coaching staff or handle conflict resolutions.

2021-08-28,"I didn't want to make this post at all, but I have a mate that is adamant Arteta is not the problem. He keeps giving me some alternate table from Christmas where Arsenal are 3rd in games played, but he doesn't listen that a single 38 game season is completely irrelevant. I don't want to be a proper dick to him because I know he is hurting, but would i be a cunt if I just said he was delusional?  Before this he was always level headed and one of the few fans of clubs that weren't mine that talked sense. He is a friend of course, but imo Arsenal are in need of results now and can't rely on a project while rock bottom. I just bring this to this forum as he is embarrassing himself after a few pints getting in screaming matches with fellow arsenal fans and anyone that will listen. Is this toxicity real between all fans here or is there a divided opinion? I really just want to know if it really is Arteta to blame or the owners as I know they have been the problem of the fans over the past few years.

2021-08-28,"- Although I think the Havertz goal was a bit lucky, it was one hell of a header. Brilliant goal.
- Penalty was deserved. Unfortunately, Red Card was also deserved. Unlucky af but that's how things are.
- Trent Alexander-Arnold is probably the best youngster in the premier league, with Mason Mount a painfully close second.
- Chelsea has always been a team that relies on defence, and my god, what a masterclass in tight, boisterous and unwavering defending tonight was on their part.
- Lukaku was certainly an asset, but I'm still a bit skeptical about his fitness. Seems a bit slow, but my god does he make it up with his physicality. Still waiting to justify that price tag though IMO.
- If Chelsea hadn't conceded the red, they would've won. Liverpool defence was great, especially Matip, but not quite on par with Chelsea.
- Mendy is the best Goalkeeper in the prem right now.
- Rudiger was robbed of UEFA defender of the year.

All in All, one hell of a game. Brilliant on both sides. Chelsea defence is just a bloody wall at this point.

Arsenal - Most probably the Invincibles season

Therefore, we all saw the best years of Ronaldo that increased the fame of EPL and even if we were rivals we enjoyed his growth into the Messi Ronaldo GOATs era.

2021-08-28,"Now of course Ronaldo is one of the best players ever (IMO he is the 3rd best player ever after Messi and Maradona, maybe 4th depending on how I feel about Pele) but he really isn’t the same as he used to be. He’s 36 years old so will no doubt come into issues with fitness as the premier league, I’d be very surprised if he even manages 30 games in good form. I also believe that while Bruno is a great player, from what I watched of them in the Euros, they seemed to be competing with each other at points. I understand Ronaldo will definitely make more money in shirt sales than what united paid for him and being quite a bit of value, but a 36 year old Ronaldo in the form I saw him in at the Euros will not be enough for United to win the league. Anyway, what does everyone else think about the signing?Unpopular opinion: Ronaldo is not what United need, and will not be enough for them to win the league",,0

2021-08-28,"Does anyone else get the impression that Man City as a club  are so scared of being labelled as an oil money pumping club that they take actions such as refusing to pay for expensive players or not giving players big contracts, when others will happily do so. PSG seem to give no fucks and now they are sitting on Neymar, Messi and Mbappe, among others stars.

Yes City bought Graelish, but then they suddenly wouldn't pay what Spurs wanted for Kane, as if saving 30 million pounds was a better option than getting the final player needed in their squad. I think City actually are scared to throw money around because then in their eyes it would solidify their plastic club status, but hilariously everyone already sees them that way anyway, so why not just run with it and get the best players in the world if you're going to be derided and hated by the rest?

At the very least this season will be interesting due to how many viable contenders there are for the league and if City lose the title, it'll be funny when they inevitably try to say, we are trying to be a sustainable club, as if they are giving trophies out for sustainability.Why are Man City so scared of the ""oil money"" label?",,0

2021-08-28,"In my opinion, the top 3 teams from the Championship should get promoted only if they're better than the bottom 3 in the Premier League. One way to achieve this would be to have playoffs for qualification but I don't think we will have the time to conduct a mini League of 6 teams (30 games in total - home+away). So we divide teams into two pots - 3 from PL in one and 3 from Championship in the other and have a knockout tournament in which every team plays a randomly picked opponent from the other pot (6 games in total). Winners from the 3 matches play in the PL and the other 3 teams play in Championship. 

Cons/Shortcomings:
- You can't really say that the winning team is better since it's just a couple of matches. One bad day can mean a lot.
- I'm not sure if the bottom three in PL have better resources compared to top 3 in Championship - if that's the case, it'll make it harder for Championship teams to get promoted.I think the Premier League relegation rules should be modified.",,0

2021-08-27,"Opinions have changed within literally hours. They called Cristiano Ronaldo a snake. For just rumours and negotiations. Not even a full deal. And now that he's back in ManU everybody is happy.

I feel like ManU fans aren't football fans. This immense hatred for ManCity seems overkill for a rivalry. I don't think they think of ManCity as a rival they will actually burn T-shirts over player transfers.

The hypocrisy, the toxicity displayed by the fans and unbelievably players like Rio Ferdinand and Rooney to text and exclusively ask Ronaldo not to join City!? Like they don't even care if the player wants to take decisions to prosper in his career. They want their hatred to be satisfied.

A player joining another team shouldn't make you this hostile if you're a fan of the club and sport and not of the drama. If joining another club is enough for a player to burn his legacy and be hated by the fans then the fans are the problem, not the player.

Yes, I'm a City fan and I'm disappointed he's not coming here but it hurts knowing that the reason is not entirely because of logistical issues or him not fitting into our manager's plans. It was also partly due to emotional blackmail by former players and fans.United fans are being very toxic.",,0

It was approved by Amazon today and is live in the UK Alexa skill store.

Feedback would be great, it's version 0.1 so there's lots of room for improvement I'm sure.

Coming up on the features list is goals scored notifications for your selected team(s) i.e. Alexa will send a notification to your device when a goal is scored.

Hope this post is OK and isn't too self-promotion-y.

2021-08-22,I am new to the Premier League and am just wondering why this is. It seems odd to me that the title for the league for the whole season would be allowed to come down to a tie breaker like that when another game could be played to definitively determine head to head which team deserves the title. It also seems that this penalizes certain styles of play as well. In an individual game the goal is to win and a team that focuses mainly on defending and does that exceptionally well and scores less will likely have less big wins and will definitely have less goals than a very high scoring team with average defense. If you put these teams head to head it could prove that the defensively oriented team is better but this system favors the offensively oriented team. Not trying to come in as a new fan and demand everything changes but just wondering why things are this way and would also kind of like to know if this is something that people all generally agree on or something that many people think is stupid.Why is the League title allowed to be decided by tiebreakers of goal differential and then goals scored instead of having a playoff whenever teams are tied for first place in points?,,0

He just doesn’t appear on the pitch and whenever he’s playing it’s like Everton are playing with 10 players. Sorry Everton fans, it seems like Arsenal have scammed you. He’s going to score against us now isn’t he?Alex Iwobi is a bang average player",,0

2021-08-21,"The UK has a rule from the 60s that no football games can be streamed or shown on TV between 2:45 pm and 5:15 pm as a way to protect attendance at lower league clubs. 

However, we can tell from other leagues around the world that don't have this rule that attendance will not drop, at least not by a noticeable amount, and the money the club can get from streaming their own game has been helpful for them especially if they have a small stadium. 

So why does the UK still have this rule when all the evidence points to it doing nothing but harm.The 3 pm Blackout rule is outdated and genuinely stupid",,0

2021-08-20,"**Disclaimer**  
This is not a jibe at Liverpool or their fans, it is simply my humble opinion on past events and my prediction for the upcoming season based on past events. I know Liverpool fans can get very defensive on here and downvote when someone isn't praising them, but please try to hear me out and respond back with why you think I am wrong (if you do).   


So, I think that Liverpool are destined to crumble at the end of this season, or possibly earlier. I think Jurgen Klopp is largely to blame and I don't think they will win something for another 4/5 years. Here is why:  


**Good team but not a good squad.**  
I think that Liverpool's starting 11 is great, I think they play beautiful football of course, but they heavily rely on their starting 11 across multiple competitions with only a few players being rotated. I think that Chelsea and City are the only teams this season to challenge for ALL competitions they are in because they are intelligent in the sense they have large squads and the array of talent is so vast. I think Man United aren't there yet, but they are close. Like I said I think Liverpool's options after their starting 11 are pretty average.  


**Injuries last season wasn't a case of horribly bad luck.**  
Asides from the VVD injury, I think the injuries in the squad last season were bound to happen. Think about it, this team was built to perfection in around 3 years by Klopp and their play style is IMMENSE, lots of running, lots of pressing, the work rate required is very high.   


This team (pretty much week in week out the same 11) has been playing like this for 3 seasons straight, CL winning season, PL winning season and the season gone. You simply cannot play in such an intense way for so long without having consequences. I don't care how fit these lads are, the body cannot take it. That to me, boils down to poor squad management.   


I think last season was a warning that this is the beginning of the end for the squad in terms of maintaining that play style and that crosses over into my next point. Liverpool didn't learn their lesson with the injuries last season by choosing not to strengthen their squad. They just signed one starting worthy player (they didn't know Robertson would get injured, shocker).  


**Klopp is not an adaptable coach.**  
Klopp is not a Mourinho or a Pep or a Fergy. He only knows one way of playing, the way we have seen the past few years. He cannot change his system, tactics etc based on opposition or around his own hinderances. Case in point last season, they fell off because with all the injuries he didn't know what to do, because all he knows is one way.   


Dont get me wrong he is great at getting the best out of his players and the style he implements is amazing. But like I said, he has no plan B incase things go south, his only plan B is to do plan A better.Why I think Klopp will be responsible for Liverpool's inevitable downfall.",,0

Even IF City are willing to let him go rather cheaply, what club is there that can offer him more playing time while also meeting the quality he seems to demand (rightly refusing Tottenham)

I’m an avid Monterrey fan from the Mexican Liga MX and they hold this tournament against the US where pretty much the top 11 of the entire mexican league faces the top 11 of the entire US league. (Pretty sure the MLS initially started this). And i’m sure a proposal like this has been mentioned before among the europe’s top clubs but if it hasn’t wouldnt it be cool to watch English, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, German, etc leagues all create an Allstar Team off of the players that play in that league and face off in a knockout competition against the other leagues, and winners take the price money back to their league and split it either among all clubs or among the clubs which had players in that all star squad.

2021-08-19,"Many seem to favor City or United to win the premier league this season and they couldn’t be further off. Chelsea will run away with the league and they’ll do so going unbeaten, here’s why.

Firstly, Thomas Tuchel, he is quite simply the best manager in the world at the moment. Revolutionizing the defense and instilling the winning culture back into the club. During the 2020-21 season, under Lampard Chelsea had 7 clean sheets (4th), 23 goals conceded (11th), and an xGA of 19.2 (2nd) in 19 games. Under Tuchel, these improved to 11 clean sheets (1st), 13 goals conceded (1st) and an xGA of 11.7 (1st) in 19 games. This impressive defensive record will continue this upcoming season as I expect Mendy to beat Petr Cechs record of 24 clean sheets in a single season.

Secondly, Squad Depth, to be able to withstand a long grueling season in the premier league a team needs depth, and Chelsea have plenty of that. They could legitimately field two title challenging starting XI’s.

Attackers: Lukaku, Werner, Havertz, Mount, Pulisic, Ziyech, CHO.

Midfielders: Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic, RLC, Bakayoko, Barkley.

Defenders: Azpilicueta, James, Chillwell, Alonso, Emerson, Zappacosta, Silva, Chalobah, Rudiger, Zouma, Christensen, Ampadu, Sarr.

GKs: Mendy, Kepa.

Not only do they have an abundance of quality players, many of them have also played in multiple positions under Tuchel. This will be important throughout the season as it will be difficult for opponents to prepare properly when they don’t know exactly what to expect. This may be the reason Pep has found it so difficult to outsmart Tuchel, losing each of their 3 meetings last season.

Finally, Romelu Lukaku, as good as Chelsea is defensively, they aren’t quite there yet when it comes to the attack. Lukaku changes that. Under Tuchel Chelsea had 25 goals (10th), and an xG of 36.14 (3rd). This discrepancy in goals and expected goals shows how many big chances Chelsea missed. This is where Lukaku will help. No knock on Werner, as I think he is an integral part of this team with his pace and ability to get in behind which allows players like Mount and Havertz to find pockets of space to create in, but if Lukaku gets the chances that Werner had last season, expect no less than 25 goals.

The only thing I can see stopping Chelsea from going unbeaten is a Kane transfer to City, even then Chelsea will still win the league comfortably. Currently at 13/4 odds, I’d suggest you go and win some free money.Chelsea Invincibles 2021-2022",,0

2021-08-17,"I might be a bit biased, but I personally don't believe Grealish is a smart signing for City. I'm not saying this because of the Tottenham defeat. I think Grealish is more of a creative playmaker. I know his best position is on the wing, but even from the wing he tends to play a more creative role. 
Looking at City's squad right now, I don't think it was necessary to spend that kind of money on someone like Grealish. They need to sign attackers. Even if Pep plans to play with a false 9, he needs an inside forward (like Salah, Mane, Rashford and even Auba. I'm not saying they should sign these players, but players that can play similar roles) who can score 15 goals a season. Looking at the current City squad, I don't see any player being a reliable goal scorer. 
I know City won the league last season as well with a similar team, but this year will be different. Man United, Chelsea and Liverpool have all improved their squads greatly. I don't doubt the fact that Grealish improves City, but considering they have players like KDB, Foden, Bernardo Silva who can play similar roles (even if not as well). 

TLDR: City need an attacker much more than Grealish, considering they already have Foden, KDB, Bernardo Silva.Do you think Jack Grealish is worth 100 million?",,0

2021-08-17,"I’ve said this on another thread, but the whole ‘big club’ thing is pointless. Usually it’s only there as a stick to beat other fans with or to justify corporate love-ins for sides like Man United or Liverpool. The fans of any club have traditions and meaningful moments for them. Talking about how big they are often serves to undermine them. We should be celebrating the great moments of every side whether it’s Manchester United or Northampton Town.

A few examples that have been asked about over the last few days:

Leeds got to the European Cup (Champions League) final in 1975 and were only the second English club to do so. They were very unlucky to lose with some controversial decisions and even the Bayern players admitted Leeds were the better side. It doesn’t undermine the achievement nor diminish the meaningfulness of the moment for fans that a glut of English wins came straight afterwards.

Newcastle had near misses in the league in the 90s. It was a memorable side that played football the fans loved but plenty of people will be as reductionist as ‘but they didn’t win’. But again that makes no difference to the impact they had on a whole city at the time.

Not mentioned but a good example: Brighton have never won the FA Cup, but they came very close in 1983. In the last minute Gordon Smith had a golden opportunity to seal the victory (a fanzine is named after the commentary ‘Smith Must Score!’) but it was saved. Manchester United hammered them in the replay. But after all this time how many Man United fans know it even happened? But what does it mean to Brighton fans?

The whole ‘trophies are everything’ thing is such a modern invention in the days when most clubs are basically barred from success by billionaire financiers. There’s respect and enjoyment to be found at every club no matter what honours are on the wall of your tunnel. If we actually remember what’s important in all this rather than empower the kind of thinking that makes people think the super league is a good idea we’ll enjoy it all much more.The big club debate is pointless and patronises loyal fans",,0

2021-08-16,"Never understood that logic, 

doing it because of wages makes sense, thats something the player themselves asks for, but doing it because somebody decided to pay a certain price for them, doesn't make sense. Pogba didn't say ""pay 89m for me"",  Grealish didn't say ""pay 100m for me"" So why do people judge and say well he's 100m he should be doing this or, that's what you expect from a 100m player etc 

Unnecessary pressure for the wrong reasons that the player has no say over. 
As I say judging a players performance based on their wage demands makes sense but price tag doesn't.

I see ex players doing it aswell, i would've thought them, of all people would know that's unfair on the player.
Would love the consensus to move away from that narrative to a more realistic one.Why to this day, do fans/pundits put pressure on a player due to his price tag?",,0

2021-08-15,"Arsenal’s automations and rotations were arguably the best in the league vs Brentford and their press/progression was very calm. 

However, they faced calamitous moments occasionally and essentially all of this can be attributed to Leno. Leno is arguably the worst GK in the league and always has been. 

He can’t distribute, can’t build and his shot stopping is overrated, it’s very tame. Hollywood saves create the illusion of competency. 

All of you must remember 2-1 vs City where Arteta was heralded a genius, both goals are from expert playing out the back.

2021-08-15,"Watching this game has been great. I’m glad football is back. I’m definitely unimpressed with City right now but I know they’ll sort it out eventually.

My question is about City’s lack of pace or at least their use of pace. Pep seems to have made the team extremely slow and technical, which has definitely proven to work for him for the most part. Today it was missed all over the pitch. The loss of players like Sané and the insistence on adding players like Grealish to a stacked midfield just seem hard to justify. Spurs really aren’t anything fantastic, but they played the anti pep tactic and it worked. Possession is fun, but you need fast players to penetrate IMO.

2021-08-14,Let’s hear some of these answers and why!Everyone’s favorite league player not on your favorite team.,,0
2021-08-14,"Arsenal: 6.5/10. Great atmosphere on big games, can be a bit dead during less important games. 

Aston Villa: 7/10. Known to have good atmosphere but when I went it was on and off. Can go 10 or so minutes without a song that isnt Villa Villa Villa.

Brentford: 6/10. I know against Arsenal they had a good atmosphere, but I've been to a few games in the championship and this is probably the fairest score.

Brighton: 4/10. Family club. Not very creative chants, diehard fans seem to be spread out so no real energy. Gets a 4 purely because the noise picks up with the action.

Burnley: 4.5/10. All the noise is in one corner. Lots of respect for Burnley, but atmosphere isnt great.

Chelsea: 6/10. On big games they are known to have great atmosphere, but I've been a few times away and it's quite dead. Same complaint as Villa but more applicable. Most of the fans that sing actual chants are located in one small part or are too quiet.

Crystal Palace 8/10. Been a few times away and once at home. Ultras help the score a bit, but most of the stadium is making noise. Only issue is once they go behind noise just plummets or attendence can sometimes be poor.  

Everton: 6/10. Great noise, shame that they have like 3 songs or would be higher. Class fans though. 

Leeds: 9/10. Been for a few championship games before and had them in the cup. Leeds speak for themselves. 

Leicester 6.5/10. Good noise. Clappers are annoying and songs are limited. Because the noise is consistent so it gets the extra .5

Liverpool: 4.5/10. European nights are good. What brings the score so low is how misrepresented the atmosphere is. They sing ynwa then that's it for the majority of the games. When I went (I've been a few times away and twice in the Kop) and I've maybe had one good experience. I went in the Kop for Liverpool v Chelsea in like 2016 and was very dissapointed. Also the score takes a hit because of the amount of phones or iPads everywhere. Thought I walked into a Apple shop when i got in.

Manchester City: 6/10. Underrated atmosphere. Attendence is definitely a bit sketchy but when the crowd gets going the noise is great. Can be a hurt with tourists on big games, but it can be a good atmosphere. Away they are good, bring numbers and make noise.

Manchester United: 7/10. Have only been for United v Arsenal away since I'm an Arsenal fan but atmosphere is good. Definitely better than some of the big clubs.

Newcastle: 5.5/10. I could deduct score purely for making me go up stairs. But to be fair I wont. From being as high up as I was, it's hard to tell whether the home fans make noise but the ones unfortunate enough to be as high up as we are can generate some noise every now and then.

Norwich: 3/10. Was really dead all 3 times I've been. Gets a 3 because I've mentioned that number a few times and they do sing some songs. Will give a shout out to the small small section of fans that actually sing. 

Southampton: 6/10. Kind of surprised at how good the atmosphere was. Obviously have the one main song but have a fair mix. Score could be a bit different from others because everytime I've been we get battered.

Scum Hotspur: without being overly bias, Spurs get a 5.5/10. They seem to be a replica of Southampton but with more tourists and their atmosphere is very inconsistent. 

Watford: I have been once to Watford and that was the opening day of the 21/22 season v Villa in the home end. Solid 8.5/10. Totally surprised. Walking in it seemed like a family ground, all patterned up to be kid friendly. Completely surprised by the atmosphere. At most there would be about 2 or so minutes without a song. Loads of variety in chants and decent limbs. This is definitely the most surprising and controversial. I do wish to repeat that this is the only Watford game I've ever been to and I know they are known to be dead, but this has made me question that. Score also takes a hit for a tiny amount of empty seats even in the home end.

West Ham: 6.5/10. Can generate great noise, limited songs and the stadium (noise is hard to generate when your so far and spaced out due to not great attendence but that's due to the stadium). Blowing bubbles is a great anthem. Reason why I say that for this and not Liverpools ynwa is because they dont need music or lyrics to sing.

Wolves: 7/10. Good atmosphere. I strongly dislike the stadiums design but the noise is good. Do think the away end would be a lot more prominent if it was a properly structured section rather than a thin strip. Could play to home atmosphere though.

This is an honest opinion on what I've experienced at these grounds. Dont get pissy because I gave your club a low score. Dont forget that I have probably been to different games than you (I'm an arsenal fan, so majority of games are (club) v arsenal).Honest score /10 of every (current) team based on home atmosphere",,0

2021-08-14,"Bit of a weird one I know, does anyone know if clubs are allowed to only water certain parts of the pitch before kick off and at half time to their advantage? Or would a club even bother doing this? Surely clubs could benefit from doing itAre clubs allowed to water the pitch to their advantage?",,0
2021-08-14,"In my opinion Liverpool has done absolutely nothing compared to the other top 4 clubs this transfer window. Signing Konate was necessary but what about the midfield and attacking options? Milner, Henderson and Thiago are not the most reliable in terms of creativity and health. We let Gini walk this summer and brought nobody in.

We also seem to stagnate with our front three every season, we go through dry spells and lack creativity and we have no backup players to bring in that can change the tempo of the game. (We’ve had that problem for several seasons now). Liverpool better hope there are no serious injuries this season since we made no major signings and everyone else has opened their checkbook.

Thoughts?How has Liverpool improved their squad?",,0
2021-08-14,"Now that 3pm kick offs are no longer on TV now stadiums are back open. I was wondering if anybody in the UK subscribes to the NBC sports package that shows all PL games.
If so, how have you found it, what is a good VPN to use for it.
